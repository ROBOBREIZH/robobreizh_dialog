b^m,okay
qw,"well what do you think about the idea of, uh, kids having to do public service work for a year?"
qy,"do you think it's a , -"
sv,"well, i, i think it's a pretty good idea"
sv,"i think they should either do that, or, or afford some time to the military, or, or helping elderly people"
aa,"yes,"
aa,"yes,"
%,"def-, -"
sv,"i, i, you know, i think that we have a bunch of elderly folks in the country that could use some help"
sv,"and i think that before we expend all our young talent overseas and, and helping other countries we ought to perhaps give a little bit of our help to our own folks at home"
sv,and 
aa,that's true
sv,"and, or the military for a year or two,"
b,yeah
sv,i think it teaches kids how to grow
qo,how about yourself?
aa,"uh, i agree with you"
sd,"uh, uh, what i'm thinking about is back , well, when i was a kid, and much earlier than that, kids were kind of, i-, i-, -"
sv,"you know, the parents kind of pushed them to join, like the boy scouts or girl scouts"
sv,"and they did, do, do do a lot of public service activities,"
sv,"but these days they're not, uh,"
sv,"par-, parents aren't encouraging their kids to do things like that"
sd,"because when i was in the girl scouts, we did a lot of public service things, because that's just part o-, of, of the scouting, and, you know -"
b,"yeah,"
%,"i've, i've, -"
sv,that's really great
sv,"i, i really think that both the boy scouts and girl scouts is a excellent, two excellent organizations"
aa,they are
%,"but parents, -"
sv,"you know, kids seem like when they get ten or twelve years old they fall out of that,"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,they do
sv,"and they don't follow it at all, you know"
sv,"there are very few scouts go on,"
aa,"oh, no"
sd,"and, and i don't know what the high rank is for the gals"
%,"but, -"
%,"i, i, uh, -"
sd,senior
b,oh
b^m,"senior,"
bk,okay
%,"so, there's not, uh, -"
%,"oh, they're just not, -"
sv,"once they get into junior high it just,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"they, they lose interest"
sv,"and then when they young, young adults,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"they're more for, i g-, -"
^2,me 
%,"not, not, -"
aa,yeah
sd,"grab,"
sd,"grab,"
sd,"grab,"
sd,walk out 
aa,"yeah,"
sv,you're absolutely right 
b,yeah
sv,i think it's a really a good thing
sd,"i, i like to see, -"
sv,"of course, there's, you know, third world countries that can use all kind of help "
b,"yeah,"
sv,"but there's a lot that can be done right here in this country,"
sv,"but i think,"
%,"i'm, you know, -"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"uh, i'm not, i'm not so sure that overseas help, helping overseas would be such a hot idea for, for, uh, a lot of young k-, people"
aa,"no,"
%,"it, it, -"
sv,"but, since there is much that needs to be done here -"
sv,"i think that, yeah, i think that we need to really address what we've done here"
sv,"and, and then perhaps even a six month tour overseas that gives them much broader outlook"
b,uh-huh
sv,"well, it's been really good"
sd,"we talked about this for a few minutes,"
sd,"and, uh, hopefully, we'll have other good topic maybe another call someday,"
sd,"but i, i don't really have too much more to say on this topic, i guess"
b,"no,"
sd,"i, i agree with you "
sv,"it, we, i guess we both agree that it's a good thing,"
b,yeah
aa,okay
fc,"well you take care,"
fc,"and, and,"
fc,"you, too"
fc,"you, too"
ft,"thank you, ma'am"
fc,bye-bye
fc,bye-bye
b,"um,"
fp,hi 
sd,one thing you know that i always think about when i think of public education -
sd,"cause i went through the public, um, school system of boston,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, i always felt that i graduated high school"
sd,"and i still didn't even i, i couldn't put together a map of the united state"
b,um
qy,you know what i mean
ny,uh-huh
sv,an yet i felt that i got a good education
sd,"and i, i did well in school"
sd,"but you tell me to name, you know, five continents"
sd,"an i,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i just felt like there were some real basics that are missing from education,"
b,uh
sv,"and the people are, are leaving school not even knowing some common sense things"
b,yeah
%,"one, -"
sd,"well, talking about public education, um, i'm, we're doing a proposal,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"it's, we're doing it at n c state,"
b,yeah
sd,"we're trying to improve the computer science curriculum,"
b,uh-huh
sv,so that's kind of in a higher level 
b,right
sv,so it's interesting that you chose that topic 
b,"yeah,"
qy,"um, did you do through a public school system or private?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"well, i went through private an until ninth grade"
bk,"uh-huh,"
qy,did you notice a big difference?
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sv,a big difference
qo,like in what sense?
sv,"well, um, in, uh, public schools i guess there wer-, there are a lot of, of, you know, -"
sv,people can take lower level courses an get away with learning nothing
b,uh-huh
sv,"but, um, private school you couldn't do that,"
b,uh-huh
sv,you had to learn
b,"yeah,"
sd,i work in a temporary agency
sd,"an they're people that come in, you know, every day to fill out an application,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and they'll have to bring somebody with them,"
sd,"and they will show that they completed, um, four year of high school,"
sd,"yet when it comes to even answering the questions on a simple application,"
b,uh
sv,that's bad
sv,it's just incredible
b,"yeah,"
sd,"our state cut a whole bunch of a, i think it's ten million dollars out of the school budget"
b,really
sd,so they're making all kind of cuts
sv,"in college people cannot, i mean, the teachers can't make tests any more,"
sd,"and th-, the library canceling all of it's subscriptions"
b,yeah
sv,it's pretty sorry
aa,"i know,"
%,"um, they, uh, -"
sd,i forget -
sv,"i think it's, um, some place in new york because they're having budget problems,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i mean they're not getting rid of any of the sports,"
b,uh
sd,they're not cutting in any other corner
sd,they're closing the libraries
sv,"that to me shows a little, uh, switch in priorities"
b,yeah
%,you know
qy,so do you go to college right now?
%,"are yo-, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,it's my last year 
qy^d,"you're a, so you're a senior now"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i'm working on my projects trying to graduate 
ba,"oh, good for you"
b,yeah
ba,"that's great,"
qy,"um, is, is n c university is that, uh, state, -"
sd,n c state
br,what did you say?
sd,n c state
b^m,"n c state,"
qy^d,that's a state university then
ny,yeah
b,i see
qy^d,and you're from there also?
ny,"well, yeah,"
sd,"i was, uh, i was born in wylie"
sd,"and then i lived in ,"
b,uh-huh
bk,i see
sd,and now i'm back here going to school
sv,"well, pretty soon it's going to get to the point where no one is going to be able to afford to send their kids to college or to do go to college"
b,yeah
sv,it's just a outrageously expensive
sd,luckily state is one of the cheap ones
qy,oh is it
ny,yeah
%,"well, still though -"
sv,"i mean, you know, thousands of dollars, -"
sv,"yeah, state's not that bad "
ba,"oh, well, that's good"
b,yeah
ba,that's good
sd,i went to a private university
h,"and, um, i don't know"
sd,i look back now
sv,"and i, i think that i probably would have done it differently if i, um, you know, could do it over again"
b,yeah
sd,"but, um, i have a lot of friends that went to state schools or didn't even go to school, some, some of them,"
sv,and i still feel like they came out knowing just as much as i did
sd,i really do
sv,and that's probably a pretty sad thing to say
%,"but, um, -"
b,"yeah,"
h,"i don't know,"
%,"i,"
qw,where did you go?
br,what?
qw,where did you go?
sd,i went to brandice university
b,uh-huh
sd,it's in massachusetts
sd,"and, um, i really felt like i've been working now for about four years,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and i, i feel like what i've learned working is a hundred times more valuable then what learned in school"
b,oh
sv,"and i know that i'm drawing a lot of what i learned in school, you know,"
sv,"i, i probably just subconsciously rely a lot on, on art"
h,"but, um, i don't know"
sd,"my sister's a principal at a school,"
sd,"and one thing she's trying to instill in kids, um, besides just reading and writing are just some, the golden rules,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"she calls them just some basics about, um, you know, you don't take what's not yours,"
sd,"uh, and if you want to, you know, you don't touch anybody else unless you have their permission"
sd,"like no hitting, you know,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"no pulling hair or anything like that,"
sd,"and, uh, the school that she's in is a, um, it's basically for minorities,"
sd,"um, there's a large minority population"
sd,"and, um, she's really noticed that even some of the teachers that work there -"
sv,"i think they don't value that type of student as much as you get,"
b,yeah
sv,"that's,"
bf,"that they, that they like pick on th-, the advanced students and pay more attention to them,"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,it's true
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,and i don't know if it makes them feel better -
%,"i mean the do teachers get, -"
sv,i mean personally i would get more satisfaction out of taking someone that wasn't as successful
b,yeah
sv,"and seeing what they could do verses somebody that did excel in, in areas and just watching them get better, you know"
b,yeah
sv,that's not much of a challenge
aa, that's true
qy,"but ar-, do you have any ideal what you're going into when you graduate"
na,"um, graduate school "
bh,oh yeah
ny,yeah
qy,do you know where you're going?
na,i think i'm going to chappel hill
qw,where's that?
sd,that's in chappel hill 
sd,"that's the name,"
qy,oh is that north carolina?
ny,yeah
bk,"oh, okay"
qy^d,"never heard of the, uh, tarheels?"
nn,"no,"
sd,i don't know that area
qy^d,"the a c c tarheels, u n c?"
ng,i just don't know it
b,"oh, uh, -"
sd,i don't get down there very often
sd,"they won the final four,"
b,"oh, really,"
sd,"well the way i pick the final four was, um, by the state that had the warmest climate"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so that's how i chose all mine,"
sd,so you can tell that i really didn't have that much to do with any of it
%,"but, -"
qy^d,so obviously you're into education
ny,yeah
%,"if you can be going, -"
sd,"my husband went to, is in graduate school actually right now"
b,uh-huh
%,"and, uh, -"
h,i don't know
sd,i give you a lot of credit
sd,"i couldn't do it,"
sd,"i,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,i know
b,oh
sd,"i can't wait to graduate either,"
aa,i know
sd,i've got all of this stuff due
ba,oh wow
sv,overloaded
b,"yeah,"
sd,i kind of know what you mean
fc,"well, it was really nice talking to you"
fc,all right
fc,okay
fc,good luck
fc,"all right,"
ft,thank you
fc,"all righty,"
fc,take care
fc,"all right,"
fc,bye
fc,bye-bye
qo,so what do you think?
br,"uh, the causes of crime?"
sv," um, i think it was imbalance of power in the united states"
sv,it's causing the lower class to rebel
sv,"that's why there's su-, such high crime,"
sv,"and, uh, there's crime in, uh, young people because they don't have ro-, role models "
b,yeah
sv, see too much crime on t v
sv,and they think it's the way to go
h,i don't know
qo,what do you think?
qw,"what about, -"
aa,"i agree with the upper and lower level, you know "
b,uh-huh
sv," because that's the lowest thing for themselves,"
sv,plus there's nobody for them to look up to
b,yeah
sv,but i also blame some of it on parents 
b,okay
sv, because parents aren't parents
b,yeah
sd,"because i remember even when i was growing up, -"
sd,i'm thirty-five 
b,okay
sd," i remember when i was growing up,"
sd,"and i had friends,"
sd,"they used to do stuff like, you know, go over to a store and steal stuff"
sd,"my mother warned us, it's like, i don't care what your friends do"
sd,"if you do it, then that was it"
b,yeah
sd,and i knew that i would get in more trouble from my mother than from 
^2,from anybody else
sv,and i think 
b,yeah
sv,so they don't care
b,yeah
%,so -
aa,"yeah,"
aa,i think i can agree with that too
sd,"but now, as far as what they can do about it, i don't know"
sv,you can't make parents be parents 
aa,that's true
sv,you got to kind of make people want to do the right thing
%,you know -
sd,i don't know how you do that
sv,"i guess if you gave the, gave them jobs,"
sv,"that's another problem with the united states,"
sv,there's no jobs any more
b,yeah
%,but -
sd,"well, i've heard this one theory, that if, that if a kid commits a crime, that, uh, instead of the, prosecuting the kid, they prosecute the parent"
sd,or both of them
sv,"that would work to a point,"
sd,"now, to put the blame on the parent"
sv,"well, that'd work to a point because some kids are just bad anyway"
sv,i don't care what you do to them
b,yeah
%,"you know,"
sv,"so i think it depends on how much trouble that kid has been in, you know"
b,yeah
sv,"because a, a, a child can get into anything regar-, -"
b,yeah
sd,"i don't care how good you, they are"
b,yeah
%,"eventu-, at least one time, -"
sd,"but now if this is a repeated thing, -"
sd,"here with this child in juvenile, -"
%,"and or, to me, yeah, both of them -"
b,yeah
sv,because that means she's still not doing what she's supposed to do
sd,"because i just watched it on t v one night on one of them, um, twenty twenty, forty-eight hours, one of them shows "
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
qy^d,i don't know 
b,um
sd," it was a little, it was a little gang of them "
nn," no,"
sd,i didn't see it
b,i understand
sd,"and then when they caught him, you know, his mother sitting there,"
^q,now they going to take me away from you
sv,that meaned she was warned
b,yeah
sv,"but see, by that, i think sometimes it's a little late"
b,yeah
%,"you know, -"
sv,but i'm sure there's something can be done
b,yeah
qo,what about with adults?
qy^d,anything do any about adult crime
ny,"yeah,"
ad,start prosecuting they
sd,but really good instead of having a revolving door on the damn court system
b,yeah
sv,"well, for one, a major problem with that is the jails are overcrowded"
sv,"well, they should start with, the,"
sv,if they would get rid of
sv,"seems to me, i know there's a lot about court that people don't understand"
sv,"there's more people in jail right now for child support, okay "
b,uh-huh
b,um
sv,you ought to take all them little misdemeanor people 
b,yeah
ad," let them go,"
ad,let them go 
b,yeah
ad," you know, give them a fine, whatever,"
ad,"make them do civic duty whatever,"
aa," yeah,"
sv,"i mean seriously,"
ad," put them fools in there,"
sv,they ought to put those people to work
sd,"i call them all fools, idiots, whatever"
b,yeah
ad,"little rock stars, put all them in there"
b,um
ad,"you know, the murderers, the drug dealers, the user, put them all in"
%,jail 
b,yeah
ad,and let all the normal people go 
b,yeah
%," you know, because, okay, -"
qy,"if you write a bad check, you go to jail, right"
ny, yeah
ad,let them people go
arp_nd,well
sd,not let them go and get out of it
b,"yeah,"
sv,"they, you still have to punish them"
ad,let them go and pay their crime or their time doing something else 
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
%,"that's, -"
sv,"but pu-, don't put them in jail because they're not hardened criminals"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"and they're, they're still, they can provide for society,"
sv,whereas some of them are so far gone that they can't do anything good for society
b,uh-huh
%,so -
h,"i don't know,"
%,"some people, boy, they got, -"
sv,i think the united states has got too many problems to be worrying about everybody else
aa," yeah,"
sv,that's true
sd,"now how they going to fix it, i don't know"
sv,i don't think there is a ready solution
aa,"no,"
sv,i don't think so either
%,uh -
sv,"because the economy is down, people, you know, the, the, the low man on the pole is getting more of the, i guess, the bulk of it"
b,yeah
sv,and he's got to work extra hard just to make ends meet
sv,and they keep taking more money from us 
b,uh-huh
%," and people are get,"
sv,and they don't have any incentive to work if we're just going to take fifty percent of it
b,yeah
sv,"might as well steal,"
sd,then they don't have to pay taxes on it 
aa,that's it
b,yeah
sd,"so, you know, they, i, i, i know that's bad, but, you know, just like texas now"
b,uh-huh
sd,they could have had a lottery
sd,they don't want a lottery
qh,why not?
sv,i would rather pay for a lottery 
%,"they'd have a, -"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"because, you know, they take,"
sd,"and uncle sam takes his,"
sv,the social security which probably won't be here when i get that old 
b,um
sd,because we're paying for social security they using now
b,yeah
qw,who's going to pay for mine?
no,i don't know 
%," but it's, it's -"
sd,i'm not counting on it
aa,"no,"
sv,you don't count on social security
b,yeah
%,"but, it's, it's, -"
sd,"that's what i'm saying,"
sv,they need to do something else
b,um
%,but -
sv,crime is going to go up as long as the economy stays down
b,yeah
sv,and it's going to get worse
b,yeah
sd,that's just like last night they killed them people in that store
qw,where you at?
sd,"i'm in raleigh, north carolina"
bk,oh 
sd,no wonder you don't know that
qw,"well, where are you from?"
sd,i'm in dallas
bk,okay
sd,"but last night, they killed, uh, uh, four people in a chain food"
ba,"oh, man"
sd,"and killed them, -"
sd,"well, it was two stores side by side"
b,uh-huh
sd,"one was a store and one was like a, a fast food place,"
sd," chicken or something, i don't know"
b,yeah
sd,"anyway, they raped the women, beat them all up, including the women,"
sd,"i mean, they just beat them"
sd,stuck them in the freezer and then shot them all
ba,ow
qw,"why was, you know, why -"
^2,why did they do in the freezer?
qw," you know, why didn't they just, -"
sv,"if they was going to lock them, just lock them in the freezer, take the money, you know"
b,yeah
sv,"they didn't have to kill them or rape them, or anything"
b,um
b,um
sv,that's awful
%,"yeah,"
sd,we still get some in raleigh
sd,"i mean, not "
b,uh-huh
%, but -
sv,it's just getting really ridiculous down here
sv,"i wish i could move somewhere where, this, you know, you got to like in the country"
sv,i don't think there's anywhere where there isn't going to be crimes
sv,"well, i think, if it's, -"
sd,the town is smaller 
b,uh-huh
sd, and everybody knows everybody 
b,yeah
sv, it's harder 
b,yeah
%,"where is, -"
sv,"and, and, and see that's another thing"
sv,neighborhoods aren't neighborhoods any more
b,yeah
sv,"there's nobody is next door to you,"
sv,"you don't know your neighbors, and stuff like that"
b,yeah
%,"it's just, huh-uh, you know, -"
sd,because i moved out some apartments before because they were loaded with drug dealers
b,um
%,"and you didn't even, -"
sd,"and what the manager, the manager won't even do anything"
sv,he's probably a drug dealer himself 
b,uh-huh
sv,you never know
aa,you don't
sd,"and so i moved,"
sd,because i moved the day probably a week after one of the apartments blew up 
ba,wow
sd,and this is like across the street
sd,this was a nice part of town 
b,um
sd," and there across the street one of the apartments blew up because they were having that, making that, um, crack stuff "
b,um
sd," and then, the other time i saw the cops break down somebody's apartment around the corner"
sd,"i say, see, this is it"
bf,time to go
aa,"that's it,"
sd,and i moved
b,yeah
sd,"and, you know, now i live in like a fam-, a neighborhood in a town house,"
sv,but it's nice
h," i don't, you know"
b, yeah
sd,"i'm kind of in the same, same kind of deal, town house in a neighborhood"
%,"but, -"
sv,it's pretty nice
sv,"i don't know how they can live, a neighborhood or apartment complex"
sv,"that's what happen, that's what wrong,"
sv,"i don't think, don't rent to them "
b,yeah
sv,or rent to them and evict them because they drug dealers
ad,put it on the lease
b,yeah
^q,"if you deal drugs, you can't live here"
b,yeah
sv,most of them are too scared to do anything about it
aa,uh-huh
aa,that's it
b,yeah
fc,all right
fc,"well listen, i got to go"
fc,all righty
fc,nice talking to you
ft,and i thank you
fc,all right
fc,bye-bye
fc,bye-bye

b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
qw," well, how do you get the edge though?"
br,how do you get the edge?
aa, the the straight edge? 
sd, you just have to be real careful
b,"oh, i see"
sd,"we use, uh, uh, a two inch brush with, uh, on a slant "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd, and that mostly does it even though you still make mistakes
%,but -
qy,huh well are you going to paint the outside of your house too?
ny,"well, yeah"
sd,i think i am going to do it this spring actually
bh,oh really?
ny,"yeah,"

ba, oh nice 
sd,there are three houses on this street the same color of yellow out of six houses

sd,but 
b,yeah
%,but it -
sd,other than doing our own work i prefer it to a professional
sd,"well, our house in new mexico, it was stucco,"
sd,"but we had all this trim to paint, and lots of it"
b,yeah
sd,and we did basically seventy-five percent of the house
sd,and then i was afraid to do the eaves way up high and stuff
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, i hired this man to come in and do it a young kid"

sd,and i think he charged me a hundred dollars to finish up
%, huh 
sd, and literally i wouldn't have done it with the scaffolds because 
%,"its, -"
b,yeah
sd," and if he fell, he was dead"
sd,and he knew that 
%,"so, -"
ba,"oh, my"
sv,so that was worth it getting a professional 
aa,yeah
sd,"plus, he cleaned up my mess"
sd," oh, i think that is what we might have to do with this chimney,"
sd,"but other than that, it was pretty easy doing it ourself and caulking it and everything ourself"
b,uh-huh
sv,it wasn't too bad
%,"i mean you think, -"
qw, how much did it cost you for the paint for the outside?
sd,"shoot, maybe a hundred and fifty"
bk,yeah
sd,"since, it is a one story,"
sd,"but we did, uh, like two heavy coats over it"
sd, but then that way 
b, yeah 
sd,"but, that friend of mine that painted his house out there in your neighborhood "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd, and yet he bought like seventeen gallons
ba,my word
sd,"and, anyway, he, when he checked out "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
ba,"oh, my word"
sd,"and he had, he had, the, uh, he had already carried a ladder outside "
b,uh-huh
sd,and she wrung all that stuff up and made a mistake on the price of the paint 
b,uh-huh
sd, so she had to start all over again 
b,uh-huh
sd," and when he got outside, he noticed his receipt was like thirteen ninety-nine or something"
ba,"oh, my word"
sd,and he saw -
bf,so that was really worth it painting his own house 
aa," yeah,"
sd, it was like over two hundred dollars worth of free stuff
ba,"oh, my word "
ba,"oh, my word"
sd,"well, he really saved in that way"
b, yeah
b^m," but, yeah,"
sd,"i think we are going to do, uh, another bathroom,"
sd,"but i think i will probably just do it, in a roller"
sd,"i want to do it about the same color and just be a little, -"
sv,uh rollers are so messy
sd,we never any more
aa,"oh, i know"
sd,"but it's that, it's the textured wall"
%,"well, a little paintbrush, -"
qy,"do yo-, are you on a reg-, regular exercise program right now?"
ny,"yes,"
sd,and i hate it 
qo,how about you?
sd,"oh, well, i'm kind of off and on"
b^m,off and on
sd,"well, i guess i've been kind of off and on"
sd,"i've, uh,"
sd,right now i'm kind of off
sd,i'd say more on than off 
b,"okay,"
qw,what type of exercise do you do?
sd,"uh, i do walking on the treadmill,"
sd,and then i do low impact aerobics
bk,okay
qy^d,i guess you don't enjoy that very much
ng,"not, not really"
qy,"do you find that, uh, to be boring?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"and time consuming,"
sv,"i mean it's not just the exercise that's boring and time consuming,"
sv,"it's, uh, you know, afterwards, you know,"
sv,"then you have to take a shower and get cleaned up, you know"
b,yeah
sd,"well, i'm trying to get back in shape for softball this spring"
b,"oh, yeah"
%,"but i, -"
qy,"do you go through this, is this something that you go through every year "
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i haven't decided whether, whether i want to play yet or not"
sd,"i just bought myself a solo flex machine,"
qy^d,i don't know if you've seen those advertised on t v
ny,uh-huh
sd,"it's one of those, uh, universal type machines, exercise machines"
sd,"but i haven't really sat down and used it match yet,"
sd,so it's collecting dust right now
b," yeah,"
sv,a lot of things do that
sd,"i had an,"
sd,i used to jog somewhat
sd,"i use to have one,"
sd,"and i finally got rid of sit cause i never used it,"
sd,but i do use my treadmill 
b,"uh-huh,"
ba,"well, that's good"
%,"yeah,"
sd,my parents have a treadmill
%,"it's, -"
sd,"when i go visit them, uh, i get on that thing every now and then"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"it's nice because when the weather's bad you can't, you don't have any excuse"
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,"i just got the bicycle out today,"
sd,"and it was real nice outside,"
sd,had to get out to do something
b,"yeah,"
sd,i can't ride a bike
%,so -
sd,i've been sitting in here in the house all weekend with a cold
sd,"so thought i,"
b,oh
b,"yeah,"
sv,"it's too nice,"
sv,it's been too nice all weekend
b,"but, uh, yeah,"
sv,i need to start jog something again
sv,"i've always of that to be, uh, really one of the best forms of exercise,"
sv,"but it's terribly boring,"
sd,and so i really don't ever keep a program up consistently
qy,have you ever had any injuries from jogging?
nn,"no,"
sd,i never have
sv,"well, i don't job enough i think to develop any injuries"
sd,i usually only go about a mile or two
sd,"i guess it worries me about jogging it's that i hear that it's very hard on your body and, and that, you know, you can end up getting hurt,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"it's, it's tough on the joints if you jog on concrete,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"suppose to be much better if you find grass, uh, or, or dirt to jog on"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"that's not quite so ,"
sv,"you have to have the right,"
sv,"that's,"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"i found that,"
%,"but, -"
b,"yeah,"
sd,i don't have to buy jogging shoes all to often
sd,my don't get very much use 
sv," well, i guess my breakdown about, they say about every six months"
b,uh-huh
sd,i usually enjoy the exercise i do
sd,"but, uh, like i said i'm just not very consistent about maintaining a, a program"
sd,"so i'll, i'll bicycle"
sd,"i get into that for, for a little while and maybe go out, uh, on a consistent basis every couple of days and ride a bike for awhile,"
sd,"but then i'll get tired of doing that,"
sd,"but, uh, that gets old too in a very short order,"
b,yeah
sd,"i'm, i'm hoping that this, uh, solo flex will, uh, uh, change things a little bit,"
sd,i really need to get on a regular type of program and use that thing on a consistent basis
b,"yeah,"
ad,"well, don't let it collect dust"
ad,at least exercise while dusting it off 
b,yeah
b, well -
sd,"maybe if i can get interested in playing softball again this string i can, uh, start some type of, uh, regular program"
b,"yeah,"
ba,"that, that'll be good"
sd,"i've always found that, uh, when you write things down and set goals it's a lot easier to keep, uh, keep something going"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, when i was in high school we had a choice of, uh, taking, uh, physical education courses on exercise,"
sd,"an, uh, one of those involved a six weeks session on a universal machine, lifting weights and,"
b,oh
sd,and that was very helpful
sd,"we kept charts of our progress,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i found that to be, uh, very helpful"
qy,are you going to do that?
no,"uh, i need to,"
sd,i haven't started yet
sv,"but, uh, it's a thought"
sv,"well, that sounds like something good to do then"
sv,sounds like something i should do
b,"yeah,"
sv,nice way to start off this spring
qw,"how often do you, uh, uh, go out each week on your walking?"
sd,"well, i do, -"
sd,i switch every other day
sd,one day i walk
sd,and one day i do the aerobics
bk,"okay,"
qw,"how far, about how far do you go walking?"
^h," well, i'm trying to get my tolerance now"
sd,"i just had surgery, um, less then two months ago,"
sd,"and right now i'm just a little over about a mile and a half,"
bk,okay
sd,but i'm trying to workup to three miles
ba,"well, that's good"
sv,well they say that walking is just as good if not better then jogging
b,"yeah,"
%,"it, -"
sv,"it takes, it's just that it takes longer to get to the same effect"
b,sure
b,"yeah,"
%,but -
sv,"well, if you keep up with a consistent pace just to, uh, keep the heart rating going, uh, -"
sd,"my walkman broke,"
b,yeah
sd,"so i'm upset ,"
sd,and i just have to turn to stereo up real loud 
b,yeah
sv,but it's a lot less stressful on the joints then jogging is
aa,"yeah,"
aa,it is
%,"and this doesn't, you know, -"
sd,my treadmill has an incline
sv,"and, you know, you can get a really good workout on it"
qy,"um, do you go to an aerobics class"
qrr,"or do you watch,"
nn,"no,"
sd,"i,"
bk,okay
sd,i have a cassette
qw,"which, uh, shows do you watch on t v?"
%,"um, it's a, it's a tap-, -"
sd,i use tapes

sd,"i don't know if he's still on any more or not,"
sd,"i don-, i don't know if i get e s p n or not "
b,uh-huh
%,"but, uh, one, you know, -"
sd,"i use to watch one, watch one on the air,"
sd,"but that was back, -"
sd,"bodies in motion that's, that's the name of the one i was thinking of"
%,"that's was, -"
b,yeah
b,yeah

sd,i watched that cause he was cute 
aa,"yeah,"

b,"yeah,"
%,every now and then
sv,not everybody has a picture perfect body
b,"uh-huh,"
sv,"well, i found that they, they have just a much better program than the other shows that are on t v"
sd,i haven't watch any other ones on t v <typo watch=watched >
sd,they're on weekdays at eleven o'clock every day
b,"okay,"
ft, thanks
sd,"but,"
sv,"now, that's a thought"

sd,massachusetts
bk,okay
sd,"i'm from berkeley, california"
ba,wow!
sd,"this is quite a, quite a long distance"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,it certainly is
qy,do you have any pets?
nn,no
sd,use too
sd,"use to,"
sd,"but none, none right now"
qw,"how come, uh, you don't have any now?"
qy,you get tired of them?
sd,"well, i, i live in an apartment building"
sd,"and, and, uh, and, and, it, it, it's ju-, just not feasible "
b, yeah 
sd,"i'd love to have a dog, you know "
sd," i've got a little doggy, uh, that i've had quite, uh, quite a long time"
sd,"in fact, she just turned sixteen years old new year's eve"
%,ah
%,"and, uh , -"
%,is she?
br,i beg your pardon?
qw,what is she?
sd,"she's, uh, uh, uh, a poodle"
sd,"uh, a toy poodle, a toy poodle "
%,"and she's, -"
b, ah
b,"ah,"
sd,"my, i got my mom a teacup little mutt , "
sd,this is a little bigger than a teacup
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, it's funny how, uh, how i, i, uh, a-, acquired this animal"
sd,"uh, when i was, uh, married, my, uh, ex-wife had said that she had a friend who had a little puppy that she needed, -"
sd,"uh, the woman needed someone to baby-sit"
sd,"and, uh, this is what she had told the kids"
sd,and she even told me that
sd,"and after the two week period was up, uh, she then informed me that the woman no longer wanted the little puppy and wanted to know if we wanted to keep it"
sv,"well, after you had an animal for a couple of weeks, it's, uh, you become "
aa," oh, for sure "
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,"so, i've had this dog now for, for sixteen years"
sd,and she's been a lot of company 
sd,"uh, she's, uh, however, getting a little old"
sd,and things are starting to fail
sd,"uh, i, i live alone now"
sd,and she stays in the house all day while i go to work
sd,"and, uh, she's been holding herself pretty well the, uh, up until, you know, recently where she's been having accidents in the house because she either is losing control or she forgets where she is"
sd,"and, uh, i find a little present on the floor sometimes when i come home "
sd,"but she's, she's usually pretty good "
b," yes,"
sd,"well my, my mother has one that's, uh, -"
sd,"it's, uh, it's, uh, teacup"
sd,"and, uh, it's made such a difference for her"
%,"but, you know, just, i, e-, e-, you know, -"
sd,"the way my mom's presence countenance is, just, just for having a puppy"
%,"but, you know, having this dog -"
sd,"she's had it for, i guess three years now"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, it was, it, it's it's really made such a difference for her"
sd,"i really would like to, uh, -"
sd,i'm a disabled person 
b,uh-huh
sd," so i'm unable to, to, really take care of a pet"
sd,"and if that weren't so, i would certainly have one"
%,"i just, i just, -"
sd,it frustrates me sometimes not being able to have a dog 
b, yeah 
ad," huh well, you might want to get yourself, uh, an animal that doesn't require much attention like a cat"
b,"oh, yeah"
b,"well, yeah,"
sd,"uh, i, i, i typically am not a cat person"
sd,"i have a friend that, uh, has on occasion, uh brought her cat over for me to keep for, you know, from time to time "
sd,and this cat is like no other cat i have ever seen
sd,"and, uh, it would sleep on my chest,"
b,yeah
sd,"it's just, it's just a great cat,"
%,but -
sd," well, my, my personal preference is, is a dog"
sd,"uh, i don't know that, uh, that i would ever want a cat"
sd,"oh, i like cats"
sd,i just wouldn't want to own one
sv,uh 
sv," well, you don't own cats "
%,"but they, -"
%, yeah 
h,"i don't know,"
sv,i can't seem to communicate with a cat like i can with my dog
b,yeah
sv,"you, they, they own you "
aa,"yeah,"
aa,right 
aa, yeah
aa,right
%," that, -"
%,"yes,"
sd,we're supposed to appreciate them
sd,"well, my, my dog when i came home, uh, when i come home in the evenings, my dog greets me at the door"
sv,"i don't know that a cat would do that, uh "
b,yeah
sd,"i used to have,"
b,yeah
sd,i could just walk in the door
sd,"and she knew whether to, to, to quietly come up to me or to just run and knock me over"
sd, i mean she really could pick up on my mood 
b," yeah,"
b,yeah 
sv,"it was, uh, uncanny <<sounds like a truck>>"
sd,"huh i, i think, uh, in a way we're able to read each other pretty well because, uh, she knows when i'm upset and i know when she's not feeling good too "
%,so -
b, yeah 
sd,"i know like when she has an accident, i know she's not doing it on purpose"
sd,when 
b,yeah
sd," uh, and, and, you know, some people might not believe that"
sd,"but, but, but, uh, i do "
b,sure 
ba,"oh, absolutely"
sd,"like if i, if i put her in a room all by herself and close the door and leave her there for a few hours, uh, because i was going out she would, uh, break something or rip up the carpet or do something just to, uh, to, to let me know that she was unhappy with what i did "
bh,really?
ny,yeah
%,"that's the way, -"
sd,"well, i had that cat that i mentioned, alfie "
sd,"one morning, you know, the first thing you do is you get up and you, you, you feed this cat some-, something and, and you make sure that it can get to its litter box"
sd,"well, "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, the next morning, uh, when my roommate got up and, and, uh, did not feed it right away, it decided that, that it was going to protest"
sd,"and so it jumped up on my bed and anointed my blanket,"
^q,all right have i got your attention now? 
b," oh, yes"
sv,animals have a way of talking 
sd, alfie did
sd,i tell you if i could have gotten a hold of that cat that day
sd," i, i don't know that i'd, uh, that i'd trade my dog in for the world"
sd,"uh, it was about two years ago she got sick on me"
sd,"and i took her to the, uh, to the vet's because she wasn't eating and, and, uh, she wasn't able to jump"
sd,"she, you know, lost all her activity"
sd,"and, uh, she stayed there for one day"
sd,"and the doctor called me up and said, uh, she had a low white cell count and that, uh, she wasn't, she was dying and, uh, suggested that i take her to a working hos-, dog hospital, animal hospital "
sd,so i took his suggestion
sd,"and i, uh, took the, the dog to a hospital the dog hospital there"
sd,and they said they'd keep her there for three days
sd,"well, she ended staying there five days at a hundred and something dollars a day because she was in intensive care "
sd,it cost me over five hundred dollars
ba,ouch
sd,"plus, the, the, uh, the vet sent me a bill for what he did "
sd,"and, uh, then she recouped"
sd,she was okay for a couple of years
sd,and then she got sick on me again
sd,and i brought her to a different vet this time
sd,and i told the vet what medication i had given her and everything 
sd,"and, uh, he gave me the medication, the same medication that i gave her the last time"
sd,and she was okay
sd,and she's been okay every since
sd,it's been about two years now
ba,"huh well, that's great,"
ba,it really is
sd,"i, i'm glad that she was able to pull out of it that way and so cheaply the second time"
b,yeah
sd,"well, the, see the problem is if, if the, if someone would have came up to me and said it's going to cost you five hundred dollars to keep your dog alive"
^q,what do you want to do?
sd,i probably would have had second thoughts
aa,yeah
aa," of course, you would "
sd," but what they, well, what they do is, is they say, well it's going to cost, you know, twenty dollars for tests and forty dollars for this"
sd,"and, and, you know, and it creeps up on you"
sd,"you don't know that, uh, you know "
sd,"you really, y-, you don't know what it's going to until it's all over"
sd,"uh, to give you an example my mom had an elderly cat who, uh, whoever evidently got a hold of it -"
sd,"and, uh, the cat got sick"
sd,so she took the cat to the vet
sd,and she had the cat there for two days
sd,and then the cat died
sd,"so the doctor had called her up and said, uh, your cat died"
^q,"and you owe me this bill,"
^q,"and oh, by the way, do you want me to, to bury the cat "
sd,"so, it cost her three hundred dollars, uh,"
sd,and she didn't get the cat back
%,"so, yeah,"
sd,"they had to pay for all the medical, uh, bills that the cat ran up plus the burial expenses"
sd," and, uh, you know, she just brought the cat in because he wasn't feeling good "
sd, so that 
b, really 
ba,geez
%," at lea-, "
b, yeah
qy^d, you kind of wonder what really happened
ny,yeah
%,"well even the, you know, -"
sd,"they, they claimed they did the best that they could have have"
sd,"and then the cat, uh, died"
%,so -
ba,my goodness
sd," i'm, i'm looking for another cat for them uh,"
sd,"i, i've, i've got a little kitten, uh, that's still, uh, just being born right now"
sd,"so another five or six weeks i'll be bringing the little kitten over to, uh, to my folks"
sv,"well, that, that, that, that will make their day"
aa,yeah
sv,"i, i think it will"
sd,"because they're both in their, in their seventies and, uh, the cat, uh, although it's a little bit of work for them sometimes, it turns, it turns out to be, uh, uh, a pleasant experience for them"
sv,"uh, i think they enjoy that"
bf,only work initially
aa,yeah
sv,"for cats anyway, you know "
b, yeah 
ad,"well, listen"
fc,it's been a pleasure talking to you
fc,"well, the same here"
fc,and you take care
fc,okay
fc,bye now
fc, maybe we'll talk again sometimes 
fc,okay
qw,what is that sound?
sd,that's my buzzer at the door 
bk,"oh, okay"
fc,i'll let you go
fc,okay
fc, right 
fc, thank you 
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","night,"
fp,"fine,"
ft,thank you
sd,i understand we're supposed to talk about spaceflight
aa,yes
sd,i hope you know more about it than i do
sd,"oh, well , i just got through renting, reading, uh, space by, uh, james michener"
qy,"oh, is that right?"
sv,"and so that, uh, helped out a little bit i think"
sd,i haven't read his book
sv,i was so upset with texas that i haven't gotten into any more of his books because i thought it was just horrible
aa,"well, he tends to go into a lot of detail sometimes"
h,"well, -"
sv,and i don't think he was truthful in a lot of what he did in texas
sv,so i wasn't sure how credible he was
qy,"oh, is that right?"
qo,"but anyway, what do you think we've gained from the spaceflights?"
^h,"well , uh, i'm not sure to be honest with you,"
sv,"so, uh, this going to the moon seemed to be a exciting adventure"
%,"and, uh,"
sv,ego trip
sv,"it was nice to go there,"
sv,but i don't know that it really benefitted mankind that much
b,uh-huh
sd,"i happen to live not too far away from, -"
sd,"uh, well, i've actually worked for the company that, uh, has been blamed for the challenger disaster uh "
qy,"oh, is that right?"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, you know, that's been kind of a, a real negative feeling here"
sd,is -
b,right
sv," sure it was, you know, very unfortunate thing that occurred there"
%,"and it's, -"
qw,where do you live?
sd,"uh, we live in, uh, utah"
bk,"you live in u-,"
qy,am i talking to utah right now?
ny,uh-huh
ba,"oh, oh, great"
b,yeah
sd,because 
b,"uh,"
b,oh
sd,"i have a sister that lives in dallas,"
sd,that's how we got hooked up to the program was her 
b,i see
b,i see
%,so -
qy^d,carolyn rash?
br,pardon me?
qy,"is her name rash, carolyn rash?"
ng,"no, her name is, uh, my last name is skidmore"
b,i see
sd,"and her, her husband's name is, his last name is weight"
b,i see
%,"and, uh, -"
sv,"well, you probably know a lot about it"
sv,"i wasn't sure that they were blaming that sp-, space disaster on one company"
sd,i hadn't heard that
sd,"well, they were"
%,"there was, uh, -"
sd,"apparently the specifications for the joints, uh, -"
sd,"they were not to perform in, uh, cold weather"
sd,"and, uh, apparently there was definitely a, a joint that did not seal,"
sd,"and, uh, if you've ever seen the size of those, uh, motors "
b,uh-huh
sd,"i mean, they're as long as a football field practically and "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, and there is a lot of pressure, lot of thrust to get that much weight up in the air"
b,"oh, yeah"
%,"so it's, this book was interesting, though"
sv,"i, uh, -"
sd,"talked about how a lot of the problems they have to come, overcome to, uh, -"
sv,"it's a very complex, uh, situation to go into space"
aa,"oh, yeah,"
aa,"i would think so, too "
%,"they would, -"
sd,"the thing that he went into quite a bit of detail about how, how much of a problem it is to re-enter the earth's atmosphere"
qy,you never think about that do you?
ny,yeah
sv,i would think it would be harder to get up than it would be 
b,yeah 
sd,"but they have to come in at a, just the right angle"
sd,"if you come in at the wrong angle, what happens is they bounce off and go back into space "
b,uh-huh
sd, and if they come into it at a different angle there is so much friction that it burns them up
b,right
%,"so, -"
sd,"well, i saw one of, some of those early space capsules at smithsonian"
sv,i'm sure you've 
b,oh
sd,but 
b,uh-huh
%,they had though piles 
b,yeah
sv," but you could see where they would come off in the, how hot it got because it was still the scorch on them which was quite interesting"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i've, i've,"
%,"well, i, -"
ad,"excuse me, go ahead"
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,"i've seen more, more of the motors that, that they "
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, these were the ones that john glenn went up in "
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"the very first ones,"
sd,the little bell type things
sd,"people have commented how, uh, they were surprised at how small they were"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"they really were,"
%,they 
qy^d,looked pretty 
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,"and, uh, the whole thing was small"
sv,"and, yeah, you, i mean, you actually put it on , you know"
qy,is that right?
na,"you put it around you pretty much,"
sd,it was so small
b,huh
sv,"well, i thought there was some medical benefits that we have learned from space,"
qy,but did he go into that in the book?
ng,"not really uh, ,"
sv,i guess that's just to sell us on it
sd,"one thing's, -"
sd,"i know one thing they've, they've mentioned that i didn't get from the book, by the way,"
sd,"but, it talked about, uh, -"
sd,"they're able to manufacture, uh, different kinds of crystals "
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,it's perfectly round
b,uh-huh
sv,but i'm not sure you have to go to outer space to achieve that zero gravity
aa,"well, that's true"
%,"and, -"
b,yeah
aa,that's right 
qy,"well, do you think we should continue to support it at the level, -"
sv,"well, i thought probably one of the things they were doing that they didn't tell us was spying"
sv,because 
b,uh-huh
sv,"and with, uh "
aa,yes
sv,"uh, i think they have cut it back, to be honest with you"
b,yeah
b,uh
sd,"uh, i appreciate having the satellites"
sv,"you know, that's certainly made it nice for other purpose"
qy^d,i don't know if you have a satellite dish or not
sd,we don't 
nn,"no,"
sd,i don't
sd,i don't 
sv, but i 
b,yeah
sv,"gun control seems to be a rather, uh, timely topic, with all that's going on legislation wise"
aa,yes 
sd,"and, uh, the, the interesting scale that they assigned it, uh, the one being a banned and ten being no regulations or totally free "
sv,"i'd have to put myself pretty much in the middle, i guess"
sv,"i, i don't mind regulating all of the, the guns"
sv,and i would certainly call for a ban on certain types
sv,"now the, the wisdom as to which types, that's going to be a debate forever, i would assume"
sv,"uh, the method of, of controlling it, well that's all into how much money you want to put into the, the controls"
sd,"uh, one point that was made in the house hearings -"
%,or -
sd,"the representative stood up and said, you know, we can check a guy's credit card instantly,"
^q,"but, uh, we don't want to check his background,"
sv,and of course those are two different issues as far as privacy goes 
b,right
%," uh, -"
sd,"but there still, the, the technology exists to, to check it if they want"
%,"so, it's, it's kind of a, -"
sv,i guess you could put a dollar figure on it if you really want to make that kind of an effort and regulate it like that
sd,"and then you've got the group of people that decide that there's, there's no particular reason to have them at all"
sv,and you got to balance those against the ones that say there is some sport to it
sv,"and i guess i would fall more in the, the realm that i like the sport issue of it,"
sd,"but i, i could give it up without too much trouble,"
sv,not the world's most pleasurable thing
sv,"and it costs a bit to do it,"
b,yes 
b,right
sd,"uh, i have shot a variety of guns for a number of years,"
sv,but it's just not like golf or whatever
sv,i mean there are other things that you could go do
sv,"so, uh, i, i don't see the, the joy of shooting as, as that much of a driving factor"
sv,"i think that society could easily swing the scales the other direction just for the sake of safety of the number of kids that tend to get hurt,"
b,yeah
sd,"i don't even keep the gun in our house,"
b,right
sd,"so i don't have that problem,"
%,"but, uh, -"
sv,"it's a hard, hard topic, i guess"
sv,"a lot of people have a hard issue, a lot of hard feelings about it"
aa,"they do,"
sd,"and you, boy you can get them on either side"
sd,"and just like you say,"
sv,"uh, well i think i, i guess i'd have to place myself, uh, probably seven or eight ,"
%,"because, -"
ar,"or not, -"
sd,"w-, w-, onto no control, -"
fa,"i'm sorry, excuse me, that, -"
sd,"uh, two or three -"
b,uh-huh
sd,i was going the wrong direction
sd,"uh, because of, we had a neighbor child that was killed by another child "
sd,"and the father kept the bullets in a separate place,"
sd,"but the little boy was five years old and was intelligent enough to,"
sd,"uh, he knew where booth, both places were, loaded the gun"
sd,and they were playing cowboys and indians
sd,and he shot the other little boy right between the eyes
%,"so, uh, -"
sd,"i mean it,"
sd,it destroyed two families 
b,right
sv,"and, and i, a lot of people say that they need it for protection, uh,"
sd,"having worked at one time in baltimore, -"
%,"or, -"
sd,"i don't know if you're in the big city,"
sd,dallas
qy,"are you, -"
br,dallas?
ny,uh-huh
sv,that's a big city 
b,yeah
%,"uh, then you know that, uh, uh, -"
sv,"if you live anywhere real close that, uh, -"
%,"the safety is, uh, -"
sv,"some people argue that they need a gun to make sure that they aren't going to get shot because of the incidences of break ins and, you know"
sd,"but, uh, uh, we have never had a gun in the house with my children growing up"
%,"uh, i, uh, -"
sd,"once, uh, uh, knew a fellow that had, had been a policeman"
sd,"and he said that if you pull a gun on a robber, he's going to assume that you know how to use it well,"
sd,"and he's going to, you know, try to shoot first"
b,right
sd,"uh, so, you know, if he's got one"
sd,"uh, and if not,"
sd,"uh, then usually they, uh,"
sd,"if he's got a knife or whatever that can throw it at you,"
%,"i mean, you know "
b,right
sd,"he said that it, it was better not to have, -"
sd,"especially myself, now i'm a widow,"
%,"and, uh, -"
sd,"i, so i'm, when my handicapped son is, is not at home, i'm by myself,"
%,"but, uh, there's, -"
sd,"i still won't have a gun in the house because he said it's really , uh, playing russian roulette if you do "
%,"uh, -"
b,yeah
sv,"about the only circumstances that they'd be of any value is when you happen to already know that the, the, person was coming your way"
sv,"once you're surprised, it's too late"
aa,that's right
%,"and, and the rare,"
aa,that's right
sv,"you know, the very few of those burglaries actually occur in such a way that you knew the guy was coming,"
b,right
sv,and had time to do anything about it
aa,that's right
sd,"and, i don't have that problem,"
sd,as i don't use that argument as saying it's worth keeping one
sd,"in the, uh, n r as, uh, claim that the, uh, the constitutional, the right to bear arms and that whole statement, uh,"
sv,"it's hard to know the original intent,"
sv,"but i, i don't see it as that, that difficult of a story to believe when the opposition says that, uh, yeah, it's the right to, to arm a militia and, as opposed to just the general public"
b,right
sv,"and you have a, you have a earn a right,"
sv,"not just a privilege as it were if you're going to serve in the militia,"
sv,"then you have a right to have that arm,"
%,"but, uh, -"
aa,that's right
sd,"you know, there's all sorts of arguments there "
aa,i know 
sd," but, i don't even want to worry about what the original intent was,"
b,no
sd,they didn't have this problem back then 
aa,"no,"
aa,that's true
aa,"that,"
sv,"so, we change our rights with our social status"
aa,that's right
sd,they're man given rights
sd,"and they can be taken away by a man,"
%,"so, -"
b,right
sd," uh, the people that hide behind that, i don't worry about"
sd,they can go live in another country if they want
b,"well, yeah,"
sd,"that's how i feel, too"
sd,"i know, well, -"
sd,"e-, even here where i work, uh, we have a, a gun club"
sd,"and, of course, those people are very avid"
sd,"they, you know,"
b,uh-huh
%,"that it's not, -"
sv,"but i can't see why any, uh, o-, on the street citizen should be able to be allowed to have a machine gun"
b,right
sv,"uh, you know, when you were talking about maybe what kind of guns that would be hard to decide,"
sv,"but there are a few guns that, uh, just are not, uh, sport,"
%,"or, i mean,"
sd,i don't know too many people that use a machine gun to go sport hunting either 
b,right
sv,"so, uh, i, i think they should have at least some control over, over those things"
sd,"uh, and when you were speaking about how they can check up, you know, on credit cards,"
sd,"well, i, i understand about the privacy act and everything,"
qw,but why can't they check to see if the person who is applying for this gun has had a record or not
sv,"that, to me, would not be an unreasonable thing"
b,right
sd,"and if they do,"
sd,"course the argument with the people in the gun club, uh, is that, uh, well the people that are going to get guns are the ones that are going to steal them anyway"
b,right
sd,"and so, it's not going to be that they're buying them"
sv,"course, some of them do"
b,yeah
sv,"so it, it is a hard question "
bf,"tends to, tends to strap only the legitimate people"
sv,"most regulation does ,"
aa,"right,"
aa,"oh, yeah"
%,"and, most, -"
sv,"it's very difficult to, uh, legislate, uh, crooks or whatever you want, however you want to word it "
aa,that's right
%," so it's, -"
sv,"well, this may be a never ending topic"
sd,"i got a couple of calls waiting on me,"
fc,so i'd better let you go
fc,"okay,"
fc,well thanks for talking
fc,"okay, bye"
fc, bye-bye now
qw,"uh, so what do you do to exercise?"
%,"uh, s-, -"
sd,"i, uh, weight train, uh, three days on and one day off"
bk,uh-huh
sd,"i, uh, ride bicycles, , uh, fifteen, twenty miles, i don't know, maybe three times, maybe four times a week"
sd,"i play basketball, uh, couple times a week"
sd,i play softball one night a week
sd,"uh, that's what i do"
%,um
qo,what about yourself?
sv,that's pretty impressive
sd,"uh, i guess i bicycle"
sd,"uh, the amount varies"
sd,as much as a hundred and fifty miles a week
bk,uh-huh
sd,"uh, i guess a play softball one night a week"
sd,and i backpack a lot over the summer
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"that's, that's about the extent of it"
sd,"i mean, i don't do any of those things particularly, you know, for exercise"
sd,"but, uh, i guess the bicycling is the one thing i'll sort of, like, do if i feel like i need to go exercise "
sd,"uh, but i do it mostly for fun"
b,"yeah,"
qy,"uh, what do you ride, uh, like, a bunch of hills or pretty flat?"
sd,"it, it, it varies"
sd,"uh, out near my house is pretty hilly"
sd,"uh, but sometimes i bike to work which is about, uh, a fifteen mile trip each way"
sd,and that's mostly flat
qw,how long does that take you to get to work?
sd,"uh, about forty-five, fifty minutes"
qw,"how d-, how does that work, work out with, uh, storing your bike and showering and all that?"
b,"yeah,"
sd,it can be a pain
sd,"uh, basically, uh, i work on a campus"
sd,"so i can store my bike in my office and walk across the, uh, campus to the, uh, gym, use the shower there "
b,uh-huh
sd," uh, but, it's, it's enough of a pain, that i did it consistently one year,"
sd,"i would commute every day, uh,"
sd,but it just became such a pain
sd,"i mean we're talking, you know, forty-five, fifty minutes for biking,"
b,right
sd,"it was a big hunk, hunk of the day "
sd,"uh, and then of course another hour to get back home"
sd,"uh, so i've been doing that less, and, and concentrating more on, you know, light biking when i get home on the evening and then, you know, some more on the weekends"
b,yeah
qy,do you ride a lot of rallies or a lot of those around there?
ng,not so much
sd,"uh, i guess mostly i bike on my own"
sd,i've got a touring bike
b,uh-huh
qo,"how about you,"
qw,what kind of biking do you do?
^h,"uh, well, actually my wife just got me into it"
sd,"and i did an, did an internship at the institute for aerobics research in dallas,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i learned all the health benefits of, you know, -"
sd,"i was a solid weight trainer,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and all i did was weights and aerobic exercise
sd,"and then my wife got me into the aerobic exercise and said you really need to do it,"
sd,"so,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so i began a program couple, i don't know probably three or four weeks ago"
sd,and i did my first bike rally this saturday
sd,"i did, uh, forty, forty miles,"
%,um
sd,"and, uh, that's the longest i've ever ridden so far,"
sd,"i usually, you know, fifteen or twenty"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and it was, it was kind of hilly"
sd,"and it was pretty tough,"
sd,"but, uh, i'm looking at, uh, doing a lot more of it because, you know, my wife is really into it,"
b,"oh, i see"
sd,"and i, i kind of held her back a little bit this, this weekend"
sd,"she wanted to go, go, go,"
sd,"but,"
b,uh-huh
sv,it's good to have a partner
aa,yeah
aa,it really is
qy,"are you think of doing any, like, centuries, or -"
ny,"yeah,"
sv,"that would be cool sometime if i could, you know, work up to that"
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
qy,"i just wondered if you were going to do that mostly or more like, you know, uh, uh, touring like from vermont or, you know, that kind of,"
b,oh
sv,i mean people seem to get into different aspects
sv,"one is more of a distance, -"
sv,"and one's more, just, you know, -"
sv,they want to put some equipment on their bike and go for a tour
sd,i've never really looked into that
%,"that, you know, that's, -"
sd,my wife would just love that
b,uh-huh
sd,and i may do that sometime
sd,"there again, i'm just kind of a fledgling into this"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i've, it's kind of funny"
sd,i called this number
sd,and i was just reading through a bicycle magazine and going through all the different tours coming up
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"i mean, around texas, you, you got about five or six,"
sd,"if you live around the dallas area, you got five or six every weekend to choose from"
ba,"oh, that's nice"
%,um
sd,bicycling is really big here
sd,"i didn't know that, and, you know, until i came down here, and,"
ba,wow
b,yeah
sd,because i lived in indiana all my life
sd,"and, you know, you may say see one or two guys on a bicycle that, or above the age of fifteen or something, "
b,uh-huh
sd," but, other than that it's nothing up there like it is down here"
b,"yeah,"
sd,i'm not sure why that is
sv,"i mean, generally in the midwest it seems to be less, much less"
sv,"i mean, maybe it's because of the winters"
aa,probably
b,yeah
sv,so it makes biking a better alternative for transportation
b,yeah
sd,"it, there's a lot of bikers around here"
sv,"it's, it's really neat"
b,uh-huh
sd,"there are a lot of, a lot of resources, a lot of magazines, and stuff,"
sd,"little texas bicyclist, is like a little newspaper that comes out every month"
%,um
sd,it's free
ad,"just go to the bike shock, bi-, bike shop and pick it up,"
sd,"and it's got all the rides coming up,"
sd,"so i guess i'm going to be busy about every saturday this summer,"
ba,"oh, that's terrific"
%,"yeah,"
sd,see a little bit of texas i've never seen before
b,uh-huh
qw,"so, uh, how long have you been biking?"
sd,"oh, i guess as an adult for just about the past, uh, three years or so "
sd,"uh, you know, i guess last time i did it before that was college, which was about ten years ago"
bk,yeah
b,"and, uh, yeah,"
sd,"i guess i just never really thought about it much for a while, uh, until i suddenly discovered all my friends were basically biking a lot"
sd,"and so i thought i'd try it, too"
qy,"have you ever had a, uh, it's kind of slightly off the subject, but you ever had a, uh, a blood workup done recently or since you've been biking,"
nn,"no,"
sd,"i haven't,"
nn,no
sv,"because it really, from what i understand, it really improves your, uh, cholesterol "
%,um
sd," and, you know, it, uh, it kind of knocks down two of the big risk categories for coronary artery disease which is, uh, uh, low cardiovascular fitness, and also, uh, you know, the cholesterol"
b,uh-huh
sd,it gives you increased h d ls and decreases your l d ls
ba,"oh, that's great"
b,"yeah,"
%,so -
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i've, i've definitely noticed it's had a good effect on my pulse rate, my resting pulse"
b,yeah
sd,"you know, it gets it down to about forty"
bh,really?
ny,yeah
ba,that's good
b,yeah
qy^d,"you say you ride about a hundred, hundred fifty miles a week?"
ny,yeah
ba,man
sv,"that's, that's hard-core"
sd,"on average,"
%,yeah
qw,when do you get to begin with the winters and all that?
qw,"what time of the year do you usually embark on your, -"
qy,do you ride inside if you can't ride outside?
nn,"no,"
sd,i'm not that hard-core
sv,"i mean there are some people, -"
sd,in fact a lot of people will ride outside in the snow
sd,"they've got a, uh, mountain bike,"
b,yeah
sd,"and, i don't do that"
sd,"i basically, i, i pretty much lay off for the winter"
sd,"uh, i was thinking of getting rollers for the last winter, you know, because it will help your balance when you're indoor training"
%,um
sd,"uh, but i just, you know, more or less stocked, like an exercise bike and that kind of thing , uh,"
%,"but, yeah,"
sv,i mean winters are kind of a problem
sd,"so, i'm more or less out of shape now that i've been biking, i guess, this year for just a couple of weeks"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, but, you know, up here , it's only stopped snowing since then"
b,yeah
%,"uh, , but, yeah,"
sv,"it's, it's, it's, it's pretty good"
%,"it's, uh, -"
sd,"the main, the main thing, i guess, for me is just to enjoy it because once it starts seeming like, you know, exercise and a chore , i'll lay off it more"
b,right
bf,"so you, uh, change up your routes a lot, and keep a -"
aa,"oh, yeah,"
aa,yeah
sd,"i try to go someplace pretty different, you know, every week"
sd,"i rotate around, uh, about four different routes, uh, from my house"
sd,or i'll sometimes come in the school
sd,"it's nice coming,"
sd,"it's, it's nice riding to school because it's all along a canal path , uh,"
sd,"because it's just, it's along the erie canal up here"
qw,"so, what school is it?"
sd,"uh, university of rochester"
bk,"oh, okay"
b,yeah
sv,so it's fairly picturesque
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, so it's, it's, it's a good ride"
sv,"as long as you're not doing it every day, it's a good ride "
aa,yeah
aa,that's true
ba,sounds neat
b,yeah
%,"it's kind of, -"
sd,"i was wondering if i was going to talk with someone that never has exercised before and doesn't want to and everything else,"
sd,but got a guy that rides a hundred and fifty miles a week
sv,"that's, uh, motivating"
b,yeah
sv,that's really good
fc,well 
fc,"oh, it was good talking to you"
fc,and keep up the good work
fc,"okay,"
fc,"you, too"
fc,all right
fc,take care
fc,bye
fc,bye
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sd,"we're going to talk about the public school system,"
b,okay
ba,fantastic
sd,"well one thing that pops into my mind real quick is, uh, about the, uh, funding of, the, the school system right now"
b,yeah
sv,"evidently, uh, that's, that's a big problem"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"it's amazing, uh,"
sv,"i always thought that teachers never got paid nearly enough, i mean,"
b,right
sd,"when i was in college i, i enjoyed teaching,"
sd,'cause i did some teaching part-time
sd,and i really enjoyed that
sd,"but i wouldn't want to go teach high school or junior high,"
sd,"it just, you know, all the problems"
b,"oh, lord, i mean, yeah,"
sd,"an, you talk about stress and pressure,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","i tell you what,"
%,"it's, uh, -"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"they're putting in fifty, sixty hours a week,"
sv,"i'm sure, because they've got to grade papers and get class stuff ready"
%,"do, -"
b,right
sv,"and, you know, and they're being paid, probably half what most people being paid"
aa,"exactly,"
%,"and, -"
sd,"and we're paying basketball people, you know, millions of dollars a year for, for what, you know"
aa," that's right,"
sv,"and then they, uh, poof it off, you know, do like tarpley"
b,yeah
%,"but, uh, i -"
sv,"what gets me is i can't believe that congress, uh, or, our state legislature can't come up with, uh, some kind of workable means to have funds for the school"
%,"you know, it's, uh, -"
sd,i just don't understand that
b,"yeah,"
%,"it's, uh -"
qy,"now do you have little kids, or what?"
nn,"no, uh,"
sd,"sure don't,"
sd,my wife and i've just been married about two years
sd,"but i have a sister that's a, uh, school teacher,"
%,"and, uh -"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"my wife and i have a, a three year old, almost four and a, a two year old"
b,okay
sd,"so we're looking at the, the older one going to school next year not, not, well not this coming fall but the year after that"
b,"okay,"
bf,so it's getting close
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"he's going to be going to kindergarten,"
%,so -
b,right
sd,"so, you know, we're, we're thinking about that"
qh,what's that going to be like
qh,"are they going to be taught nothing,"
qh,"or they going be taught something,"
sd,"we're going to, we're going to be involved in our child's education"
sd,"we're going to be teaching him what we can at home, of course,"
b,right
sv,but
aa,exactly
aa,"right,"
aa,that's true
sv,"and we're going to try to teach him good values, because, you know, we-, when, when they get to upper level school and they start teaching them, well hey, if you can play football or basketball that's what's important not if you can read or write, or do, or un-, understand some science"
aa,exactly
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","i mean give me a break,"
sv,"that's, that's, that's bogus"
aa,"right,"
aa,right
sd,"well and, uh, you know, one thing my wife and i've talked about, i-, are, uh, private schools"
b,yeah
sd,"and dallas, uh, school district just recently got an advised status because of their low quality schooling"
b,right
sd,i couldn't believe that
b,right
sd,"you know, one, that's one reason we bought a house here in plano"
sd,"we were hoping, you know, well the school district's going to be good, you know, for resale value, and,"
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, i can definitely, uh, see on down the road, you know, where we do have kids and are getting to that age, that's going to be a definite concern"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"we talked, you talked about before, about the school funding"
sv,i think there's only going to be one solution to school funding which i don't think will be necessarily the best way
sv,but i think what's going to have to happen is there's going to have to be tuition for grade school and junior high and high school kids
sv,"that's the only way they're going to fund it, because if they start raising taxes for property, and people are going to throw a fit"
%,"that's, -"
b,"yeah,"
%,"and, you know, that's, -"
sv,taxes right now are political suicide
b,"oh, yeah"
sv,"and i don't think any politician's going to do that,"
%,so -
b,"yeah,"
sv,"and the only thing, they, they would think of would be tuition, you know,"
sv,if it works at colleges it will work down below
b,right
sv,"and, you know, that's going to, that's going to affect the people that are having kids in school, of course, which is probably the only fair thing to do"
sv,"but, it will be hard for those that people, that have, have in school because they have to pay out even more"
aa,exactly
sv,"and, you know, it's going to really hurt the, the middle class, uh, people, i think"
b,"oh, yeah"
aa,that's right
%,"so, uh, -"
sv,"and most of the problems with kids in school carrying guns and, and knives and everything, -"
ba,"i mean, good grief what's -"
b,yeah
sd,"now, that's, that's just unbelievable to me, you know"
sd,i can't believe that
sd,i mean when i was in junior high and high school that never happened
sd,you never heard about that
b,"well yeah,"
sd,"we didn't, we didn't even think about it, you know "
b,no
qh,"and now, you know, what do we have now"
sd,"you know, got kids that, either got a, you know, a magnum gun school, -"
ba,like good grief

sv,"and you want to encourage them, you know, to, to be active and everything in school,"

sd,"well i was, i graduated high school in nineteen seventy-nine,"

b,okay
qy^d,"that was what, twelve years ago, i guess"

aa,that's right
sd,"i'm afraid to, i'm afraid to even think about it"
aa,"that, yeah, that is a scary thought,"
h,"but, uh, i don't know,"

sv, that's all you can do
b,"yeah,"
%,and -
sv,"you got to, you got to be your child's best friend, i guess,"

aa,exactly
sv,"an, and if they go to their friends dealing drugs, they're going to be in even worse shape"
aa,that's right
sv,"and, and the schools don't, don't really encourage to stay away from that, you know,"
sv,"the schools are there to teach history and that we fought the civil war, etcetera, etcetera"
sv,they don't teach them good values like drugs are bad
h,"i, maybe i'm wrong, because i haven't, you know, been in that kind of environment for a long time,"

b,right

sv,you've got to start them at the home
b,yeah

aa,no
sv,very immature in that 
aa,"yes,"
aa,right

sd,i have a brother who spent two years in bolivia

b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh

sd,"and the, uh, home was palatial"
sd,"they had five or six servants, you know, and, and, a lot of expensive, uh, holdings and all that,"
sd,"and the ambassador said, but i know what you make as a u s senator,"
^q,how can you afford all of this?
sd,"and he said, come i'll show you"
sd,and he walked out in the backyard
sd,"and the, uh, senator said do you see that hospital over there?"

sd,and he patted his pocket

sd,"he said, you see that school over there?"

^q,"how can you afford this, uh, in such a poor country,"
sd,"and he, he said, come i'll show you"
sd,and he walked out the backyard
sd,"and he said, do you see that hospital over there?"
sd,and the senator looked
sd,"and he couldn't see anything,"
sd,"he said, no"

sd,"her father was a fairly, uh, high ranking official under somoza"

sv,"of course it's a very volatile government, uh, situation, too"

b, uh-huh 
sv, but it's like in any sibling rivalry 
%,"well the, -"
sv," we're hearing the same,"
sv,"the solution discussed at one time and i think it has real merit on the drug situation is that the g-, the u s government could spend less money by buying the crop and destroying it than they are in trying to, to beef up the military and to do all other things"
sv,"i think it would be cheaper to buy it and destroy it,"
sd,"which would still give the, uh, the grower in columbia and elsewhere in latin america the, uh, the money that they apparently need and go, go to the illegal crop for"
sv,and it would save the u s money in 
^2,in the long run
sv,"and in the short run probably , too"
aa, true
qy,"course, then could, you know, at, at some point, could you ever convince someone to turn around and grow something that was productive for humankind"
nn,"no,"
nn,no

b,right
b,uh-huh
^2,"argentine beef,"

sd,"well, one of these days, uh, i hope we'll find some, some way to substitute the good crops for illegal ones"
sv,"well, let's just hope that the powers that be, uh, have time to, a little bit once in a while to, to think in some farther reaching avenues than you and i do here tonight"

b,uh-huh < >
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,i mean that's what i would like to think

b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,yeah
sv,"maybe, maybe that's what is happening"

b,uh-huh
h," but, uh, sometimes, i don't know "
b,uh-huh
sv, i think it gets in the way of the better judgment
sv,i mean just because you did something in the past doesn't mean he's not a good enough person to be a politician

sd,"for my playing the piano when i was depressed and didn't have anything else to do and there was no one to play with i could always go play with the piano, you know"
aa,true 
qw,"so, how long did you play?"
sd,only for about three months
b^m,three months
b,"yeah,"
sd,me and my brother both took the classes
sd,and we got pretty bored quick 
sd,"i was going to say, y-, y-, you got as far as the, uh, chop sticks, huh"
sd,"um, well, i could play, uh, the wood chuck song"
b^m,"oh, the wood chuck song "
sd,and i still can to this date
sd,"and your mother's saying, and although, the money that we spent for those piano lessons "
b, yeah
b,"yep,"
sd,they went out and bought us a piano
sd,and for three months 
ba,"oh, bless your heart"
qy,"did you ever, did you ever just bang on it or do anything with it at all"
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,any time i got bored 
bk,"oh, okay,"
qy,"but i mean, can you play anything on it, other than wood chuck song?"
nn,no
b^m,no
sd,"and jaws,"
sv,but i think everybody can
bk,okay
sd,"i c-, i, i can still read music if i'm lucky"
%,"because i, -"
sd,"if i work real hard i can still barely read the music,"
sd,"but, see, i played the piano "
b,yeah
%,so -
b,yeah
sd," i played chic-, uh, concertos and other stuff"
%,"but, -"
sd,"i got to the point where i wasn't really reading music, i was memorizing music,"
sd,"so because of that, i can't read music as well as i used to,"

b,yeah
sd,"but i enjoy it, though"
sd,i find it to be a good out

sd," well,"
sd,"i do know if they want me to or not,"
sd,but at least i do sing in it 
b," yeah,"
sv, that's pretty good
b,"well, -"
sd,i never really learned the music or anything

b,yeah
sd,"but after one semester of that, i said n-, no,"
^q,this isn't for me

"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","well yes,"
sd,we do have pollution in houston
%,"and it, -"
qw,how bad is it?
qy,do you have smog like they do in california?
%,"well it, it -"
no,"some, -"
sv,"i think it depends on, uh, you know, what the, ho-, the cloud cover -"
sd,"and like right now, it's, uh, it's kind of overcast, you know,"
sd,"just, it's hot,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and the sun is trying, tries to shine through"
sv,"but it's, it's holding in this, this pollution"
%,"and i, -"
sv,"it depends on whether you have some sort of temperature inversion, i take it"
aa,"i think so,"
%,"and, uh, -"
b,yeah
sd,"and we have, uh, pasadena, texas which is sort of between here an, you know, heading toward galveston,"
sd,"i mean it's still part of, it's part of the houston metroplex"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
qw,what do you think is your primary cause of it
sv,"well, i think it's industry"
sv,and i think it's cars
qy^d,you do?
qy,you really think cars contribute a lot now that they've taken lead out of gas?
%,"i don't, i, -"
h,"well maybe not,"
sv,"but, it, it sure, it sure, se-, -"
%,"you know, it, -"
sd,"i, i know that when i'm, when i'm behind a car -"
sd,"and, uh, sometimes, uh, i can really smell especially diesel and things like that,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"you know, comes right into my air conditioner"
sd,"and, you know, my head and my fa-, -"
sd,"i'm so stopped up right now,"
b,"um,"
ba,my goodness
sd,"i don't know if it's, uh, if it's partly from what's blooming, you know, right now, pollen and stuff like that,"
sd,"that's part of it,"
%,"but, um -"
b,uh-huh
sv,i think a lot of it's industrial
sv,"i also think, uh, that, uh, there is a certain amount that comes from automobiles"
sv,but it's mostly from older automobiles
sv,"i don't think the newer automobiles are as polluting, uh, frankly"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i think that, uh, i think that, uh, uh, -"
%,"if, uh, -"
sd,"i, i, i heard a story a while back"
sd,"something to the effect that if they could just pay to get twenty percent, or, take all the cars off the road that have been, uh, manufactured say before nineteen seventy-five,"
b,uh-huh
qy,"you mean, uh, fifty percent pollution total "
ny,yeah
^2,"from, from cars -"
sd,"that is, not, not total but just from cars, -"
%,okay
bk,"oh, uh-huh"
sv,"so, that i think would be tremendous help"
sd,but i happen to drive an old model car because it's very economical
sd,"and it just keeps getting, uh, gives me good service"
sd,and i don't have an incentive to get rid of it as long as it keeps running good and not costing me any money
b,uh-huh
sv,on the other hand i know it's a much more polluter than any of the newer model cars i have
b,uh-huh
sd,but i don't have any incentive to get out of it until it dies
b,right
sv,"and, uh, that may be part of the problem"
%,"als-, -"
qy,"do you all have pollution in your co-, part of the country, uh, from industry?"
ny,"yeah, ause"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"oh, uh, yeah,"
sv,"it's, it's, uh, pretty heavy up here i think"
sv,"but i think it's mostly industrial, is what i really, uh, believe is the, the main problem"
%,"and, and, uh, ause -"
sv,"and, uh, uh, people, uh, i don't think are paying as close attention to it in this area as they frankly should"
sv,"i, i we, we seem to have a high, uh, cancer rate up here in maryland"
bh,"really,"
ny,"yeah,"
%,"and, uh, -"
%,"like what ki-, -"
qy,any particular kind or just all kinds?
sv,"well, for instance breast cancer seems to be pretty rampant"
%,"and, uh, i think, -"
sv,"of course prostrate cancer's sort of bad for everybody,"
sd,"but, uh, th-, this state was like the second, -"
sd,"my wife's a registered nurse,"
sv,"and i think this state was like second this year from the top, in terms of, uh, cancer rate for just all kinds"
sv,and i can't help but believe that's not partially caused from pollution
sv,"i just don't know exactly what it necessarily is,"
sv,but i just can't believe it is
b,um
sd,"now we have a lot of pollution being caused by cloruph-, uh, fluorocarbons which is the, like freon twelve and freon twenty-two"
sd,"they use freon twenty-two in air conditioning systems in houses and the like and heat pumps,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and they use freon twelve in car air conditioners
sv,and that's also what's causing our atmosphere to lose it's ozone layer
b,uh-huh
sv,"and i can't help believe if it's sufficient enough to make the atmosphere lose it's ozone layer, that it's not acting as a pollutant in our lungs also,"
sv,"and having all kinds of effects,"
%,and -
qw,"well what can we do about the, the, the, the air conditioning problem?"
sd,"well they're working now, -"
sd,"i know dupont and dow and several other chemical companies are working, uh, feverishly to try to come up with a substitute for fluorocarbons,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and who ever does is going to make, uh, a mint"
sd,"because if they ever come up with a reasonable working agent in place of fluorocarbons, then, uh, -"
qy,"is that also what's in, uh, hairsp-, aerosol?"
na,"well they used to be,"
sd,but they made them take it out of that
qy^d,"even, so, so the aerosol is still aerosol,"
na,right
qy^d,but it doesn't have anything that's damaging
nn,"no,"
sd,"they, they, they passed a law and made them take the fluorocarbons out of the aerosol containers,"
b,"uh-huh,"
sv,well that's good
sv,and that was a move in the right direction
sd,we are doing some things to try to correct the problem
sv,but there are more things we could do
sv,"and getting rid of old cars, like i said is one way to help correct the problem"
sv,"uh, uh, just trying to i think be careful, uh, with the way you handle garbage,"
sd,"i notice in this state, -"
sd,"i don't know if you're doing it in texas yet or not,"
sd,"but in this state we have special containers now we have to put all our cans and bottles and plastic pieces, uh, you know, containers in,"
%,yeah
sd,"here, they've just started, started doing that,"
%,"it's, it's, you know, -"
sd,"you're not, you don't have to, -"
%,"but m-, you know, -"
sd,i know i am
sd,"i save, -"
b,"yeah,"
sd,well we are doing it pretty religiously in our group too
%,"but they, uh, -"
sd,"in one of the counties here, they're actually doing a trial program of having a trash police"
sd,they have a lady that goes around like a meter maid
sd,and she spot checks people's trash
ba,"no kidding,"
b,"really,"
b,oh
sd,"and if they find a bottle or a can or anything like that in your trash,"
bh,is that right
sv,"well, we need to do something,"
sv,we need to get serious about it
b,"yeah,"
%,"you, -"
b,"right,"
sv,"you've got to get people to see i-, -"
sv,"and surprisingly enough just handling of trash, uh, can cut pollution, uh, from, uh, uh, from just throwing it in a dump, or, or, or, where ever else they used to do with it, maybe used to burn it"
sd,they've stopped that up here too
b,uh-huh
sv,"but that, that will cut pollution too"
sv,"because you get a lot of out gassing from these things, i think, decaying and tr-, and trying to, -"
sd,"for instance cans and bottles, they never go away at all"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but on, on the other hand, i don't guess they're polluting"
sv,"but plastic containers and the like, uh, they may be,"
sd,i'm not sure of that
qo,"how much does, uh, planting more trees and things like that help?"
sv,oh i think that's very important to do
%, too
sv,"i, i really think that, uh, trying to get along with your environment and help it out is a very, very important thing"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, uh, that can help to cut pollution, i guess some"
sv,"i, i don't know how much trees actually act as filtering agents in terms of pulling various pollutants or chemicals out of the air"
sv,"i would hope that they would help some, though"
sv,that's for sure
sv,"i think, uh, it seems like there was something going on, around here, that, you know, -"
sd,"we have all these chemical plants and oil refineries and those kind of things and that they burn off a lot of stuff,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and some of the stuff that they weren't supposed to do that somebody found out, you know, like in the middle of the night, they would go ahead and do it anyway"
sd,i think they got caught
ba,oh good
sd,"but i wonder how much of that kind of stuff, you know, goes on"
sv,"well that, uh, that i think may go on a lot"
sv,"and the primary reason i think it may go on a lot is just as you said, somebody happened to stay up late at night or something"
sv,"i don't think we have a adequate policing, uh, particularly on industry"
sv,"uh, we have good policing, at least in this state and, and several of the surrounding states and probably yours too, of car pollutants"
sd,"because we have to go down, uh, once a year here in maryland and get out car's exhaust systems checked for emission content"
sd,"uh, we have to, uh, we have to have a state inspection every year"
b,uh-huh
qy,do you all have that?
nn,"uh, no,"
sd,"we don't have a state inspection,"
%,"so, -"
%,"which i, -"
%,"i don-, -"
%,"i would assu-, -"
sd,but any time you sell a car or buy a car it has to be inspected in this state
qy^d,"so i'm assu-, i'm assuming that, you know, they check, they check everything for safety"
%,"or, -"
no,"i don't know,"
sd,"uh, that's something that you'd have to just check with your authorities"
sd,"but in this state we have to, uh, pay eight dollars and a half and go to a, an emission station once a year and get every one of our cars checked that are, have been made starting in nineteen seventy-three"
qy^d,"but that's all they check for,"
qy^d,"they don't check how good, -"
qy^d,if your tires are good enough or your brakes are good enough
nn,"no,"
nn,"no,"
sd,we don't have inspections like that
sd,"now, i'm in maryland,"
sv,"in virginia they check that every two years, i think"
sd,"we do that ev-, every year"
sv,"and i think that's a good idea too,"
sd,"not, no-, not that it necessarily has anything to do with cutting pollution necessarily,"
sv,but i think it's a good idea
sd,"the emission check, though, is required in maryland"
sd,"and it's also required in virginia, uh, a sister state to, to this one"
sv,"and that's, that goes a long ways towards cutting pollutants"
sd,"well i'll have to check,"
sd,"i'm not sure if, if our state inspection ever-, -"
sd,"once a year has to do, you know, -"
sd,"if they check the, uh, -"
b,"uh-huh,"
sv,"well if they don't i would imagine in time they'll get a law with i-, get around to it,"
sv,"and if they don't then that's something i would certainly, uh, uh, suggest you be willing to uh, uh, be for in terms of, uh, -"
sd,"oh, i would "
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"i'm for anything that cleans up the air or the water or, or, or anything"
aa,"oh yeah,"
aa,"i, i agree"
sd,now that's another area we haven't even discussed
sd,"and that is water pollution and various of the other types of, uh, of, uh, like food pollution"
sd,"i mean you, you hardly ever hear, hear anybody say anything about food pollution"
sv,"but i think there we have a pretty good handle on inspection of foods in this countries,"
sd,"so, uh, hopefully we're not ingesting too much in the way of, uh, pollutants in our food"
%,"but water pollution, uh, -"
sd,"i've worried, especially the last few years about just how good the water supply we have in this country is for drinking and the like"
b,uh-huh
sd,i know a lot more people are going to bottled water
arp_nd,well -
sv,and that's not necessarily the answer either
sd,because they've found out that that's just comes out of somebody's tap
b,"yeah,"
b^m,"tap,"
%,yeah 
%,"so, -"
%,"but a lot of these, uh, -"
%,some of this -
sv,"well, you know, a lot of people have well water,"
sd,in fact in this area too
%,"and, an, you know, -"
%,"and, uh, -"
b,uh-huh
sd,"if you don't get it tested you don't necessarily know what you're, what you're drinking"
sd,"and i, i know a lot of people, you know, have that"
sv,"and, you know, you have to wonder if that, you know could have an adverse affect on them too,"
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i'm absolutely for drinking water out of wells as long as you first of course, have it checked"
sv,"because it seems, uh, -"
sd,"when i was a kid growing up down south, uh, i used to go out in the country where my grandparents were"
sd,"and we had a well,"
sd,"it was one of those draws that, -"
sd,"i forget what you call those things,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, and that was some of the best tasting water,"
sd,"i mean, i can still to this day taste that water"
%,"when we were, -"
sd,"when i was growing up i lived in huntsville, alabama,"
b,yeah
sd,"and their water supply came from, uh, spring"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and it was like ice cold, spring water"
sd,"and i guess parts of the, the city still ha-, you know, get that,"
sv,"but, uh, that was, that was really wonderful"
ba,"oh, i bet it was"
sv,"it was really, really good"
b,"yeah,"
%,"the-, -"
sv,"once it's been filtered an if it's a deep enough well, filtered through all the earth and everything i think that, uh, -"
sv,it depends of course where you are
sv,"a good well, though, i think is very healthy "
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay, uh,"
qw,"could you tell me what you think contributes most to, uh, air pollution?"
^h,"well, it's hard to say"
sv,"i mean, while it's certainly the case that things like automobiles and factories, uh, pollute a lot, uh, if you look at how much pollution is say kicked up by an active volcano, uh, it's certainly less than clear that anything man can do in this sort of scale of things has much effect at all"
qo,what do you think?
sd,"um, well, you talked about, uh, volcanos"
sd,"i'm not sure how many active volcanos there are now, and, and what the amount of material that they do, uh, put into the atmosphere"
sv,"i think probably the greatest cause is, uh, vehicles,"
b,uh-huh
qy,"um, uh, do you live right in the city itself?"
nn,"no,"
sd,"i'm more out in the suburbs,"
sd,but i certainly work near a city
bk,"okay,"
qy,"so ca-,"
qo,how about you?
%,"well it's, it's, -"
sd,i live in a rural area
b,uh-huh
sd,"it's mainly farms and, uh, no heavy industry"
sd,"attleboro, itself, -"
sd,i live in rhode island
b,"oh, i see"
sd,"and, it's in the north,"
sd,"i live up in the, uh, northeast corner"
sd,"and attleboro sits in just over the line,"
b,uh-huh
sd,but there isn't a lot of heavy industry
sd,there's the freeways
sd,"and we get an occasional, -"
sd,"it depends which way the wind's blowing from boston, cause we're like forty miles south of boston,"
sd,so we'll pick up that
sd,"and, uh, i've noticed over the past say, maybe five or six years, uh, -"
sd,we live about twenty miles away from the state airport
sd,"and i notice that the fly patterns now of the jets are getting bigger,"
sd,"they're swinging wider so that now they are coming over, over our homes"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, it seems like, uh, we're catching all that residue"
sd,i'm not sure if it's kerosene or what that's dropping
sd,"but, other than that, you know, we don't have the, unless we're catching it from the midwest, the emissions"
b,yeah
bf,you mean like from the coal
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"we generate, -"
sd,"one of our, our biggest electrical plants in rhode island uses coal to, uh,"
%,"um,"
sv,"um, there doesn't seem to be much emission from them,"
sd,but i'm not sure about the rest of the country
b,"yeah,"
sv,i notice locally a major problem is kodak
sv,"um, it's interesting"
sd,"because in order to, uh, keep with the e p a standards which, which tend to be visible, uh, what's coming out of your smokestack, they do all their emissions at night"
sd,"uh, so people get up, -"
b,"okay,"
bh,"well, is that right? "
ny,"yeah,"
sd,people get up in the morning in that neighborhood
sd,"and they've got this black ash on their cars,"
b,"yeah,"
ba,"surprise, surprise"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i mean, i really think that if the e p a had anything on the ball they'd go in there with a few phosphorous grenades, light up the sky, photograph the emissions at that point, and, uh, you know, -"
b,yeah
sv,"there, there must be, uh, uh, some of the, some of the, uh, larger plants up, uh, up around one hundred twenty-eight"
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, we've got reports that, uh, -"
sd,"during the night seems like they'd blow off their, their stacks from, uh,"
b,right
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, they do that at night too, because,"
b,right
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"so, you're right,"
sv,"they could do something a- about, about that, i guess"
aa,yeah
sv,that seems a little ridiculous
qo,"how are your, uh, your lakes,"
%,"and, uh, -"
sd,oh they've been getting cleaner
qy^d,they have?
na,sure

sd,"i'm not sure how much the water pollution is, is directly related to the air pollution, other than acid rain,"
%,"yeah,"
b^m,"acid rain,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"that's, that's what i was, uh, -"
sd,"i mean the stuff i've read recently in technology review basically indicates that acid rain may be a little bit, uh, overstated that a lot of the die off they've seen in forests may not really be due to acid rain at all"

h,i'm not an expert

sd,"and they thought that was more beneficial because, you know it, it, some of it does soak in"
sd,"and some of it runs off right away into the, in to the streams and rivers"
sd,and some of the fish were supposedly making a comeback
b,uh-huh
sd,i can't remember where -
sd,"i, i read that recently somewhere,"
sd,and i can't remember where
b,"yeah,"
ba,"that's interesti-,"
sv,"but i, i thought it was up there"
sv,"so, that's interesting because new hampshire,"
b,uh-huh
%,um
qy,"um, you kind of think it's something else then?"
arp_nd,"well, that's what the environmentalists were claiming in this article"
%,"so that, -"
bf,"oh, they didn't say, they didn't say what though,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","they just said they thought it was, -"
na,"they didn't say what,"
sd,"they just said they thought acid rain's contribution may be less than was previously suspected um, that it may be other natural things at work um,"
bf,"uh, natural disease,"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"so it's, it's less than clear"
sd,"like i said, i don't remember the article that well"
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
h,"but, um, i don't know,"
qw,"i mean, what do you think we can, uh, i guess as individuals or as a group, do about, uh, air pollution? < >"
sv,"uh, we can demand, uh, more efficient automobiles for one thing"
sv,"i still think that's, that's, uh, one of our major causes of pollutants"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, how we go about that, it's uh, uh, it's a little bit difficult"
sv,"i think it's up to individuals too, to ask automakers for,"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"you ne-, yo-, ne-, i think you need a, a vehicle something like, uh, ralph nader, nader's raiders, or,"
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
qy,do you really think that new vehicles though is a big problem
sd,"i mean, i remember reading an article that said like, it's, uh, the older polluters,"
sd,"the, the twelve and fifteen year old cars, you know, contribute like ninety percent,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"and the new cars it's hardly is, hardly anything"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"they're better,"
qh,but how about all the trucks and buses that are out there
qw,"uh, when was the last time you saw a truck that didn't belch, smoke, or, uh, -"
b,"yeah,"
qy,but doesn't that just mean they're out of tune
no,"uh, i'm not really sure"
qy^d,"you think that, that, that the, uh, the trucking indus-, industry is that, uh, incompetent, that they wouldn't, you know, -"
sd,"fuel is, is one of their biggest costs"
b,right
%,"so, you would, -"
%,but diesel engines
b,"yeah,"
sd,diesel engines
%,"it, you know, it's, it, -"
sv,"i mean, they do generate a lot of soot"
sv,"but that at least, that kind of particulate comes out of the air pretty quickly"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"we could also, uh, push for legislation for, uh, rapid transit systems"
sv,this country seems to be a little behind on that
b,yeah
sv,on the other hand most people don't use rapid transit because it's so inconvenient
b,"um, yeah,"
sv,"but only because we got used to, uh, single person, single car,"
b,uh-huh
sv,a lot of people don't even like to carpool
b,uh-huh
sd,but we could that
sv,"that'll help,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"the, uh, united states and canada are i guess, is, is, going into, uh, some types of agreements to limit, uh, what's being given out by power plants,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i guess canada's quite concerned that we're sending a lot of our stuff up there,"
b,"yeah,"
b,sure
sv,so that's helping
qw,"well, what do you think about like a device, a meter right on a tail pipe"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",and you pay the tax based on how much you polluted?
ba,now that's an idea
ad,"don't say that too loud though because, uh, every city and town will have a meter on your tail pipe generating generating revenue, "
sd," well, it just means if you don't pollute, right, or you pollute very little you don't have to pay any tax"
sd,or you just buy one of these things
%,"and it, it, uh, -"
sv,"maybe you, you could probably devise them so it slowly closed off your tail pipe"
sd,"and, uh, the less you pollute the longer the devise lasts"
sd,and if you pollute a lot then it closed off your tail pipe
sd,and you couldn't start your car anymore
ba,"that's a, that's an interesting concept"
qy,is that your idea?
ny,"yeah,"
%,"but, uh, you know, it's, uh, -"
sv,"i guess the difficulty would be to, that somebody could obviously just take it right off the tail pipe again"
sv,so you probably would have to build it right into the muffler or something 
sd," well i was going to say, "
aa,right
sd,"you could put it in, you could, you could, it could be installed like a catalytic converter"
b,right
sv,i mean i guess you could take those off too
%,"but, -"
%,"you could take ca-, -"
sv,but mufflers would be a little more obvious if you took that off
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"if you can take a muffler off and only replace, -"
sd,well not unless it was built into every muffler
b,right
%,and that's -
sd,"but if you was talking about something which was more or less universal that, uh, busses and any kind of vehicle,"
ba,"that's a, that's quite a concept"
sv,"you should, uh, pursue that i think, or patent it, you know"
aa," yeah,"
sd,"patent it,"
sv,that's a good idea
sv,if you could come up with a device that's the thing
b,right
sv,but it shouldn't be too hard to do something like that
sd,"but that's a, that's a thought"
%,"no,"
b,uh-huh
sv,you're right
sv,"and that will solve, uh, a lot of problems"
sv,"i don't know if you, uh, if you approached the automobile industry if they would be too keen on installing something like that"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, but you know a proposal to, uh, uh, i guess the proper authorities, -"
b,uh-huh
sv,"well you might, uh, generate some -"
b,"yeah,"
bf,the automobile regulatory agencies or something
ny," yeah,"
sv,you might generate some interest in it
sv,"but that's, that's a good idea"
sv,"other than that i'm not sure what, what individuals can do other than like i said get involved through a group or an organization"
b,uh-huh
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
sv,"uh, far as, you know, crime in the cities, i'm sure, like in yours it's pretty, pretty bad"
sv,"uh, probably the biggest thing we've got going now is the robberies"
sv,and theft and probably murder 
b,uh-huh
qo,how about you?
h,"uh, well, i don't actually live in the city,"
aap_am,but i'd probably say that's roughly right
sv,"i mean crimes against property seem to outnumber crimes against life,"
sv,"but i, i think with the current war on drugs and all this kind of stuff i'd say probably the police department would claim the number one crimes, crimes are probably solicitation of prostitution, uh, and sale of drugs"
aa,uh-huh
sv,"prob-, probably right, if you look at it from that stand point"
b,uh-huh
%,"what, uh, -"
qy,"is there anything, uh, that you particularly are concerned with in your particular area as far as security and that sort of thing?"
sd,"uh, where i live now it's, it's not so bad"
sd,i mean i can basically leave my front door unlocked and not have to worry about it
sd,"uh, but i do have friends that live in the city"
sv,"and i think that they get a lot of fallout from this war on drug thing uh, just because there are, like, crack houses, you know, on their street and stuff like this"
b,uh-huh
qy,"do you live in a real small town or, or out in the country?"
sd,"i live out in the country,"
%,yeah
qw,"how far out from the city, i mean, do you, -"
sd,i'm about fifteen miles out
b^m,about fifteen miles
sd,"i live in a little suburb, uh, which is, i guess from dallas is twelve miles or so "
b,uh-huh
sd, but it's pretty congested
sd,"we are considered in the country,"
%,um
sv,but it doesn't really feel like you're in the country
%,um
sv,"our major crimes in our immediate town, uh, is probably robberies, house robberies "
b,uh-huh
sv,"however, i'm sure they're there"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, right now our neighborhood is running about, uh, eighty percent of the homeowners have been robbed,"
ba,wow
sv, that's huge 
sd,"and since that time everybody's got some sort of burglar system or, you know, uh, burglar alarms "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"it's cut back, you know, considerably,"
sv,"but it, it just shifts it from our neighborhood to another neighborhood to other neighborhood,"
sv,"so it still, uh, remains city wide, pretty, pretty high"
qy,"are there, are there any theories on why this is happening?"
sv,"uh, i would say the majority of it's happening during the day, uh, between probably ten in the morning and three in the afternoon"
b,uh-huh
%,"most, -"
qw,but why?
qw,why is it happening?
sd,"well, most families, most families are young"
sd,and both people are working
b,uh-huh
sd,so they're happening during the hours they're gone from work
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, so, uh, i would say that's probably their prime motivation"
sv,"they'll, they'll stock your house and, uh, look at your pattern and then go from there"
qy^d,so they're professionals?
na,"uh, they classify most of them as professionals"
%,um
sd,"uh, you get a few of them that are a little bit sloppier, uh, just taking, uh, you know, just junk items that they, they can just get, you know, ten to twenty bucks for real quick"
b,uh-huh
sv,"probably the biggest items that, uh, that you get in our neighborhood, or, would be the high classed automobiles,"
sd,"the, you know, mercedes, volvos, things that they can get, you know, big dollars for "
b,uh-huh
sd,"guns, that sort of stuff"
%,um
sd,"very few, you know, penny, penny ante stuff"
qw,"well, what do you think can be done to reduce that sort of crime?"
sv,"well, uh, the police force, for one,"
sv,"i think they could, uh, definitely add to the police force and the type equipment that they use"
%,"uh, it's,"
sv,"oh, right now i think, we are about thirty thousand people"
sd,"and there's only eight officers that patrol for thirty,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,right
%,"and, -"
sv,"but, i mean, that's going to tend to, -"
sv,"i mean it seems to me that sort of approach will tend to simply make the cost of committing the crime slightly higher ,"
sv,"in other words, you've increased the probability of somebody being caught a little bit"
sv,the real question is how do you convince people not to commit such crimes in the first place
%,"well, the, -"
sd,"course in our particular state, uh, we have the prison overcrowding, whatever,"
sd,"so they're giving the early release, uh,"
b,right
sd,"they're doing that in our state, too"
b,"yeah,"
%,"and, and it's, -"
sd,"i think what they need to do is stop building more jails and start giving stiffer sentences, uh,"
%,"but for the, -"
qy,so you think that would be a deterrent?
na,"that would be, certainly be a deterrent"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, uh, not necessarily, you know, give in to their, uh, human rights desires"
ad,"you know, if they're overcrowded, just keep cramming them in there till they just suffocate uh,"
qw,"well, what about an innocent person who happens to have been found guilty?"
sv,"uh, i think they'd have to go to extra measures to make sure a person's guilty, you know, in a lot of cases"
sv,"course, i, i know you can't be a hundred percent foolproof"
b,right
%,"uh,"
bf,"so you'd, you'd rather see it harder to convict somebody"
aa,"i'd rather see it a little bit harder and have a little bit more evidence,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and then those convicted, especially of, you know, murder and, and, uh, you know, major crimes,"
b,uh-huh
%,huh
sd,"uh, especially, you know, in the case of murder "
b,right
sd," uh, i know in my case, i, my wife and daughter were kidnapped,"
ba,"oh, wow"
ba,"oh, my goodness"
sd," and we caught, the individuals got caught,"
sd,"we, uh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, you know, two counts of kidnapping, uh "
b,uh-huh
b,right
ba,wow
sd,"and, you know, he was out within two months because of the parole system"
%,"so what, what, -"
qy,"did you, did you sue him under the civil system?"
br,do what now?
qy,did you sue him under the civil system?
nn,"n-, no"
sd,i'm not real familiar with that
sv,"well, you could probably sue him for mental anguish or something, right,"
b,oh
%,"and, -"
sd,"well, the insurance companies and all that tried to, tried to go after him"
sd,"and they said, well, you know, he, they're, he has no job,"
^q,"he has nothing,"
^q,"there's nothing that he has that, that you could go after"
b,yeah
sv,"makes you wish that had, uh, still had indentured servitude, for this sort of thing"
aa,yeah
%,"uh, very seld-, -"
sd,but they give the guy a job in prison and make him pay his damn debt
b,yeah
sd,they don't do that here
sd,"course they pay them,"
%,"but they don't, you don't, -"
sd,you or the insurance companies never see any of that money
b,"yeah,"
ba,that's too bad
sd,"and, uh, you know, and they're , right now they're reluctant to go after him because they're, you know, they're, they're repeat offenders,"
sd,"they, uh, been in jail before ,"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"they've been released, you know, several times, which is another,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, you know, basically the guy commits, you know three major crimes and, and, uh,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i, i think that's re-, -"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"and we're out, you know, uh, you know, fifteen thousand dollars"
sd,"and,"
ba,that's awful < >
sd,and he goes out and commits it again
sd,"fact, he's back in jail now"
%,"so, what, what, uh, -"
sv,gives you sympathy for the vigilantes
aa,yeah
qh,"what, what deterrent does he really have?"
b,yeah
b^m,"yeah,"
sv,"i think in our, in our particular neighborhood, vigilantism is becoming a real, real possibility"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, we've had a couple instances where break ins where the people have actually, you know, shot the people "
ba,"oh, my god"
sd," and, uh, return offenders have, -"
sd,"they've actually waited for them, where they've robbed, you know, particular neighborhood,"
sd,"they'll rob one house,"
sd,"then other people will wait up, you know, and wait for somebody to do something else, try to take it in their own hands"
b,right
sd,course it doesn't always work out in their favor
b,right
sd,"but, uh, nevertheless,"
b,uh-huh
^q,"you can,"
b,right
^q,you can't get all of us
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, and we're beginning to see more and more of that"
sv,"and that, that's a deterrent, too if you think the home owner might be armed, right, and awake "
b,yeah
sd," here you break in,"
sd,and you're going to get shot
b,"yeah,"
sv,"that's, i mean that's certainly a possibility in, in, -"
sd,"we have had a few cases where the guy has broken in, you know, during the middle of the night and gotten himself shot to death"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, it helps for a while "
b,uh-huh
sd," but then just another different set of people come in,"
sd,"and most of the people are transients from out, outside of the state"
%,huh
sv,"uh, i would say probably eighty percent of them that are caught, they're from places like up in oklahoma, and louisiana, arkansas, you know, across the, the border"
ba,"wow,"
sd,"so, you know, people who don't readily read the newspapers in our town or whatever "
b,uh-huh
sv, it's not many from the local communities
b,uh-huh
sv,"but, uh, it's a problem,"
sv,"and i, i just, i think that the court systems need to be more accurate in, in, stiffer in their penalties,"
b,yeah
sv,would be a definite deterrent
sv,"and,"
b,yeah
aa,uh-huh
aa,"i mean, i, i tend to agree with you"
sv,"i think, uh, what i would like to see is, number one, completely getting rid of these victimless crimes uh, there's no reason to enforce those and spend time and money doing it "
b,right
sv,"and i think one of the big things that you can do is, to increase deterrence is, uh, if someone is found guilty of a, uh, felony level offense, they lose their citizenship"
sd,and they lose their constitutional rights
b,uh-huh
sv,"and just a lot of things that we're trying to worry about, you know, protecting these people from, we just don't protect them"
sd,"i know like in my wife's case, they made her feel like the criminal"
aa,"i know,"
sv,"and i think, i think that's ridiculous"
%,"they, they went to all, all -"
qw," uh, well what would you say your opinion is on gun control?"
h,"well, i don't know"
sd,"i've, i've had mixed emotions, i guess, when i listen to, uh, the radio and, and watch t v about the different, uh, things that are happening"
sd,"uh, i'm against it"
sd,"but on the same token, uh, i went out and purchased a gun just because i wanted the right to do that "
%," ye-, -"
sd," so i, i have a rifle in the house"
sd,"uh, the ammunition is probably so old i'm afraid to use it"
sd,"but, uh, i bought it for target practicing and, uh, and also because i wanted a weapon"
qo,"uh, how do you feel about it?"
sv,"well, i think, uh, down here in texas they don't have a waiting period on handguns"
%,huh
sv,"and, i think they need that"
sd,"uh, and i do have a, i have a pistol"
sd,it's a little twenty-two
sd,and i have a twenty-two or a twelve gauge shotgun
b,uh-huh
sd,"an-, you know, i do like to have my guns"
sd," uh, i don't know if i'll ever use it, you know"
sd,"and like you, my bullets to my little pistol's probably, uh, about three years old "
sd,"uh, my gun hasn't been shot in a year or two"
b,uh-huh
sd," but, uh, i like to have them where handy"
sd,"well, up, uh, up in new england where i'm from, uh, you had to get a permit before you could buy any amu-, am-, ammunition"
sv,and i thought that was really good
sv,"and i think if they, uh, -"
sd,"takes two weeks for that system to process, uh, your request for, uh, not as a gun permit but, uh, but to buy ammunition"
sd,you have to get a permit from the police station in your local area to do that
sd, i've never heard of anything like that
b,"yeah uh,"
sv, that would be nice
%," but, "
sv,the criminals that are going to get their guns one 
aa, i 
sv,"i think, you know, one of the things that, that, that needs to happen is, uh, to, to stop the impulse buyer from, uh, buying it quickly and, and, uh,"
sv,"but if someone's really determined to, to pick up a firearm you can pick it up any place"
b, yeah
sv, and you can get them really cheap
aa,i know
sd,"i, i had a waiting period on my pistol because i was down in, uh, tennessee"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, we bought it there"
%," and, -"
qw, how long was the waiting period out there?
sd,about nine days
%,huh
sv,"that wasn't too, too bad"
aa,no
aa,no 
sv,"because if, if you're going to go buy something, uh, uh, of that nature, i think you, you're going to have some idea as to what you're going to do with it"
sv,you're not going to react that quickly
sv,"in other words, you know, you don't have a need to go buy a gun to go shoot it the next day"
%,"th-, -"
sv,"somebody wants to do that, -"
sv,"i, i, at times i think they ought to have a waiting period on all firearms"
aa,yeah
sv,"i do too uh, because it doesn't make any difference, uh, uh, whether it's a pistol or a shotgun, i suppose"
sd,they both do the same kind of job 
sv, a shotgun hurts worse than a pistol does
aap_am,"uh, yeah"
aap_am,i suppose
sd,i never got shot with either one
h,"but i don't know, uh,"
sv,i think you could recover from a pistol but not from a shotgun 
aa,"no,"
sv,a shotgun's got too much of a spread
sd, or at 
b, yeah 
%,"uh, it's, you know, -"
sd,"you have a little, uh, thing on the bo-, bottom of th-, on top of the barrel "
b,uh-huh
sd,you can make it either tight or as loose as loose can get
b,oh
sd,and the spread changes
sd,"uh, i've got a manual single shot"
sd,"and i guess it doesn't have any, any automatic features to it"
sd,"the further away i get, the, the, uh, wider the shot gets "
b, yeah
sd,"and the closer that i get, the tighter that it gets"
sd,it's got a hell of a kick to it
b,yeah
sd,"my husband had a, uh, a police gun at one time"
sd,and i shot that thing one time
sd,almost knocked me down
%," and it just a li-, -"
sd," i don-, i forget,"
sv,i think it was a three fifty-seven
h,i'm not sure
qy,do you belong to a gun club or you? -
sd,he belonged to one awhile back
sd,"uh, since we moved, -"
sd,we've only been here in texas for about a year 
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, we can't even find a place to shoot just for "
ba, no kidding 
sd,i'd love to get used to that shotgun
sd,we traded his pistol for that shotgun
sd,"huh well the, the, uh, clubs that we've got around here are kind of expensive"
sv,"but, uh, it's well worth it"
sd,"you can go down and shoot up against a sand bag and some targets and have, uh, competition"
sd,"uh, i've never really joined a club because i haven't got the time not because i haven't got the desire"
sd,"uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high"
sd,"plus there's ini-, an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member"
sd,so the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club
sd,"plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in"
b,yeah
sd,"well, that's what my husband, -"
sd,when he was in that gun club where he was doing that <<can't tell if it's a cough or something was hit>> -
%,"it, you know, -"
sd,"he went mostly just to, uh, shoot at paper targets"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, but, you know, they used speed and accuracy and all that"
sv,"i think that, that the gun clubs serve a useful purpose"
sv,"in fact, i'd like to see somehow they tie the legislation into not only when you buy a weapon you have to, uh, show that you've gone to school or gone to some class to know how to handle that weapon -"
ba,"that's a good, -"
sd,i've never thought of that
ba, that's a good point
%,"and, you know, it, it, -"
sv,"even after you wait your nine days, if you don't know how to handle it, it's just like putting someone in an automobile that doesn't know how to drive"
sd,and you give him a license because he waited nine days
b,yeah
%,"that's, -"
%,"and, < > yeah"
sv,"he could, he could not only, uh, uh, shoot himself"
sv,"he could, he could, uh, mishandle a weapon leave it at home and let a child get at it"
%,"it, -"
sd,"well we, uh, we was living on a navy base down in memphis"
sd,"and, uh, this one guy decided to play, uh, lonesome cowboy or something"
sd,and he was twirling his gun around and shot himself in his foot
ba,wow
sv,he was fortunate
sd,"he could, he could of hit something else "
sd," well, he went tumbling down the steps along with, uh, shooting his foot almost off"
sd,he broke his leg and 
ba,wow
sd,"i can't remember what the na-, the term was going around"
sd,it was about four or five years ago
sv," but now, i guess that would be a good idea "
bf,"about, uh, private citizens selling a weapons?"
sd,like if you wanted to sell your pistol to me
qo,how do you feel about that?
qy,"do you believe there ought to be legislation guiding the, uh, buyer and the seller?"
qrr,"and, or do you believe that you ought to be able to sell your system, uh,"
h,"uh, that's a hard one because we did that"
sd,"but, uh, i think there ought to be some rule against it"
%,"i'll, uh, you know, -"
sv,"the person who sells the gun ought to protect themselves because if that gun's registered to them and somebody else uses that gun in something, the cops are going to come to you"
b,yeah
qy," i-, isn't "
%," uh, "
no,i have no idea
sd, i've only 
%, because i 
sd,"and i've kept it, you "
b,yeah
qy,is it registered?
ny,yeah
%,"i-, -"
sd,"the, uh, the rifle that i've got is not registered,"
sd,"and, uh, i don't know why i never registered it"
%,"but the, uh, -"
sv,i don't think you have to register a shotgun 
sv," um, i, i think it's, it's voluntary "
%,"the, uh, the, -"
sd,"well, see, uh, my husband has a thing"
sd,"if they go to, uh, regulating, uh, all right, uh, banning guns pri-, pri-, pri-, private cit-, citizens -"
b,yeah
%," this, -"
sd,my kid is jumping on me
sd,i can't hardly talk
sd,my husband feels that they'll come and collect everybody's guns
aap_am,yeah
aap_am,i guess that could happen
sv,"it's just like the, uh, the social security system "
sd,"once they, uh, they gave everybody a number"
sd,"and now they're making you, uh, uh, get one at, at birth"
sd, and 
b, yeah 
sv,"and if you try to do anything, uh, like, uh, not identify yourself to the government, they know who you are"
aa, yeah
^2,and everything about you

%,"uh, i, -"
sv,"bu-, bu-, you know, they know so, how much money you make a week to, uh, probably your, uh, -"
sd,my kid is banging
sd,i was seeing what they was banging on

%,"oh, the soc-, -"
aa,yeah
sv,"they, they probably know everything from, half the time wh-, ho-, what time you go to the bathroom"
aa, they probably do 
ar," no,"
sv,that's that's a little bit extreme
sv,but they could know anything and everything about you
sd,"and, uh, i'd like to have my gun"
sd,"if they go to banding, banning them, i'd lose my gun"
sd,"but we wouldn't lose our pis-, our, uh, shotgun"
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, we're wanting to get a couple of more that no one knows about"
b,uh-huh

sd,"uh, you go and ever-, you know, always see guns in there"
b,yeah
sd,it comes out every tuesday
qy^d,"and there's, there's no waiting period on that"
nn,no
sd,none whatsoever 
sd,"you call, -"
sd,we sold a refrigerator through it
sd,and it took us all of twelve hours
bf,to sell the refrigerator?
ny,yeah
b,yeah
sv,you know and i'm sure it'd be even less for somebody with a good gun
sv,"huh and i think the federal government is, uh, is really far away from, uh, uh, control"
sd,"i, i don't believe in, uh, -"
sd,"i'm s-, i shouldn't probably say control"
sd,i mean regulation
sd,control is something that i wouldn't want the federal government to have
sd,"uh, but i would like to see them have a monitoring capability so that they know who has what weapons"
aa,yeah
sv,"well, i agree with you there"
sv,they do have too much control over us already
b,yeah
sd,"uh, we could look at our paychecks and see how much control they have"
sv," unfortunately, we, uh, we vote for the, the people who spend the money,"
sv,so i can't complain too much
b," yeah,"
sv,i guess so
h,i don't know
%,"they're , -"
sd," well, i haven't heard anything about the proposal myself,"
sd,"but, uh,"
b,"no,"
sd,i haven't either
sv,"i've, i've always felt for a long time that i, i think that all young kids ought to do a stint, uh, primarily in the military"
b,yeah
%,uh
sd,"most countries require that now,"
sd,they 
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sd,"i don't know about the young women,"
sd,"i don't know if they have to serve in the military, "
b," yeah,"
%,"a lot,"
%,"yeah,"
sd," well, you take israel "
sd," i mean, everybody does"
b,yeah
sv,"i don't think it's a bad idea,"
sv,"teaches, teaches a lot"
sd,"i mean, i went in the service when i was eighteen,"
b,uh-huh
bh,is that right?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"uh, did a lot of growing up"
ba,i bet
sv,you have to
b,yeah
b^m,"yeah,"
sd,my father had been in the military
sd,i didn't do it myself
sd,my father had -
sd,"and that's, uh, how he put himself through school basically"
b,yeah
sd,"he came from a poor immigrant family,"
sd,"and he didn't have a chance to, uh, you know, -"
sd,"the family wasn't wealthy,"
sd,"so he had to do something to,"
^2,do it himself 
sd,and he did
sd,and he was very successful
sd,"well, my parents wanted to send me to college,"
sd,and i was dead set against it 
sd,"you know, i had wanderlust, you know"
b,yeah
sd,"and i got in,"
sd,"and after, after wasting the first six years, partying and everything else, i decided, uh-huh, time to settle down and do something"
sd,so i started to work on my education
b,yeah
sd,"course my job was such that i didn't, i couldn't do it as much as i wanted "
b,uh-huh
sd, and still i ended up going two semesters when i got out just to get my degree
ba,that's pretty good
sd,"but, i've been in school ever since "
ba,that's good
b," yeah,"
sv,i guess
b,"yeah,"
%,"that's, uh, -"
h,i don't know
sv,"there's other kinds of service to the country that could be done, you know,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i mean if you don't like, -"
sd,"i mean, working in the national parks,"
b,sure
ba,exactly
sv," i mean, i've always felt that people on welfare should be required to spend at least part of their time, *why no slash?"
aa,"oh yeah,"
aa,"absol-,"
%,"i mean, -"
sv,"all these, all this money that we're throwing away to pay people to go out and do things when we're paying all these welfare recipients,"
sv,"and if they're able-bodied people, i don't see any problem at all with having them go out there and, and, if nothing else, get a group of them together and take them around to old folks "
b, yeah 
b,"yeah,"
sv,we'd learn service to other people 
b," sure ,"
b, sure 
%,"so i'm, -"
sv,get something out of that money
sv,"country would benefit,"
b,yeah
%,"i've, -"
%,"i mean, uh, -"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"my next door neighbor when i was growing up, worked for the unemployment division,"
sd,and his sole job was just tracking down people who were getting benefits and able-bodied
%,"and, -"
bh,that right
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"and he, he had all kinds of horror stories"
sd,"you know, these guys go down there and get their unemployment checks,"
sd,"and, back, back in those days they also use to give you, uh, booklets good for, uh, clothing and gas, and things like this "
b,yeah
sd,they get all this stuff together and sit down and have poker games 
b,yeah
sd,"and i'm, i jus-, i have a hard time dealing with that"
sd,"what i hear one time, i think it was on paul harvey's, uh, radio segment, that he said that if the money that goes into welfare each year was to be given directly to the people without all the middle people in the government bureaucracy, each person would receive like forty-five thousand dollars"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i mean, i was astounded"
sd,i don't even make that
aa,"no,"
aa,i know
sd,"i, you, you think about, you think about the layer of bureaucracy between the money and the recipient,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,and somebody's taking that away
sv,"and, and there's probably, there's easily probably six or seven times that amount being spent on the bureaucracy"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,no doubt
sv,"you know, it's, it's, it's totally ridiculous,"
sd,"and now, i, i, i, uh, started out when i first got in graduate school"
sd,"i was going into public administration,"
sd,"and, uh, quite honestly i just got so fed up with it i just couldn't stand it any more"
bh,"is that right,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i mean, this is the kind of thing you look at"
b,yeah
sd,you sit there
sd,"and when you're writing up budgets, you wonder, okay, how much money do we need"
sd,"well, you need x number dollars for the recipients"
sd,but you need x number dollars to administer the program
sv,well just ridiculous
b,yeah
sv,this is ridiculous
sv,it's sad
aa,"it is,"
sv,it's pathetic
sv,"i mean, there's got to be a different way"
sv,there's got to be a better way
sv,but it'll never happen
sv,"i mean, these "
b,yeah
b,yeah
qw,"what would happen if the required young people to do service to the country,"
qh,"what should they get in return, i wonder"
%,"like, uh, -"
sv,"i think, i think there ought to be some kind of assistance as far as, uh, -"
sd,and i would limit it strictly to something like tuition assistance
b,yeah
sd,give an incentive
^2,educational or vocational training or something
aa,yeah
sd,something that's going to help them along the way
sv,"and they'll help the country eventually, too,"
aa,"sure,"
%,"i mean, -"
%,"well, this, -"
ad,i mean 
sv,and that's only going to help
sv,"i mean, it's sad"
sd,one in five americans can't read 
b,yeah
sd," adults, that is, can't even read"
sd,"and, and we've got the lowest rates of the civilized countries in science and math"
b,yeah
qh,"i mean, what are we, what are we becoming?"
sv,we're becoming a service country
bf,as opposed to what we were twenty years ago
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"we were an industrial giant,"
sv,"and now we're no-, we're not going to do it because everybody is beating us at the game"
sd,"we taught them how to do it,"
sv,"and they, they did it better than we do"
b,yeah
sd,simple as that
sv,"because they have the ambition, i guess"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,simple as that
b,"yeah,"
sv,"which is good for them,"
sv,"but on the other hand, we kind of lose out"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,it's terrible for us
sv,"i think that if, uh, young people had service to the country might give them more ambition"
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sv,"and, and it can be good for them, too"
b,"yeah,"
b, oh yeah 
%," i mean, even, even the greedy kids that we've got now -"
ad,"oh god, you go to the mall"
sd,"and you see, you know, fourteen year old kids flaunting money, because the parents give them money to go down and play video games all night, you know "
aa,i know
%, for what
aa,i know
ad,give me the money
sd,"and i'll, i'll teach them something good "
sv,"well, you know, you know why they do it is so they can get them out of the house"
b,yeah
b^m,"yeah,"
sd,"uh, that's my other complaint"
sv,parents aren't parents any more
aa,no
sv,"they've, they've relinquished their parenting"
b,yeah
sd,one of the other subjects is do you think the public school systems are in trouble?
b,yeah
sv,"well, as a substitute teacher for a year, i, i can say yes"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i mean, i talked with somebody else about that another time,"
sd,"and, you know, when i's in graduate school working on my master's degree in math, i was, uh, teaching as part of my, part of the program"
sd,and i just love teaching
sd,"that was a lot, that's probably the most fun i had"
sd,"and, uh, it helped me out because i learned "
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sd,"and when, uh, when come time to get out of school, i thought, boy, i'd like to teach"
qw^d,"but you know, for, for what"
b,yeah
sd,"you know, i don't want to live in a little one bedroom apartment the rest of my life"
aa,exactly
sv,"i mean, that, that's a sad thing to think,"
sv,"and that's kind of selfish on my part,"
sd,"and i admit that,"
aap_am,"well, in a way it is,"
sv,but you have to look out for yourself 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's right
%,"i mean, that's some-, -"
sv,"and when we pay garbage men more than we pay teachers, -"
sv,that's wrong
aa,"yeah,"
ba,"gosh,"
%,"i mean, -"
sd,"i'm not saying that garbage men should be paid less,"
sd,i saying teachers should be paid more
aa,"no,"
aa,i mean yeah
sv,"they do an absolutely necessary job,"
sd,"i mean, i, i have a great deal of admiration for these people who can go out there and do that"
b,yeah
sv,"but, uh, i mean, there's, there's a sense of priorities here, too"
b,yeah
%,"you know, we need, -"
qh,"what's more important, picking up the garbage or educating our kids"
b,yeah
sv, they both have their place
aa,"yeah,"
%,"they, they, -"
aa,sure
sd,"but, you know, when it gets right down to it, -"
%,"i mean, one's import-, -"
ad,"i mean, on the other hand, i mean, you take a garbage man in new york city starts out at twenty-six thousand dollars"
ba,that's pretty good
sd,well i bet you there's a whole bunch of homeless people up there who would take that job for thirteen thousand dollars a year
b,yeah
sd,"i mean, my other pet peeve is unions"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,oh yeah
sv,"you know, it's just, it's, it's ridiculous the way unions have gone"
sv,there was a time when unions were needed
^2,and they served a good function
aa,"and they served a good function,"
sv,"but there are enough laws on the books now that unions are outdated,"
sv,"and they're only there to perpetuate their own, their own power structure"
sd,"i remember, the company my dad worked for, the people there went on strike against the management"
sd,"it was a steel manufacturing place,"
%,"and they, uh, -"
sd,"this was during a time when the import steel was so cheap,"
sd,and they were having a hard time
sd,"and they told the strikers there, look,"
^q,we need you to come back and get this stuff done
^q,or else we're going to be out of business
sd,"and they wouldn't come back,"
sd,so they went bankrupt
b,yeah
sd,"and, and they all lost their jobs"
b,"sure, "
sv,"and, and "
%," and it's like , you know -"
b,yeah
sd,"so many times, i mean, you had the, uh, the coal miners and steel workers going out at the same time"
sv,"and, well, that took care of that industry "
aa,that's right
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc"," and, and, then, and i'll tell you,"
sv,"detroit worked awfully hard on, on stopping car manufacturing in this country"
sv,and they're trying to do that now with the imports
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i mean, you know, we've never caught up,"
sv,and i don't think we ever will
sv,"it'll be a tough road, though"
b,"yeah,"
%,"i mean, here it is,"
sv,"and we've got, we've got to go into partnership with the japanese to build cars"
b,yeah
sv,"you know and they only did it because they, i guess they were embarrassed "
b,yeah
aa,that's about right
ba, gosh
%,"yeah,"
sd,"well, back to the original subject,"
%,"yeah,"
sv,"i think youngsters ought to go out and do some public service,"
sd,i don't care what kind it is
sv,it teaches them pride in their country
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"and pride in themselves, too"
aa,that's right
sv,"they could, they could, i mean, you could organize something just within your community"
b,"yeah,"
%,"i mean, -"
aa,that's right
sv,that's like eagle scouts
aa,sure
aa,uh-huh
sv,and that's a great idea
sd,"i think they ought to take them and, i don't know, just have sort of like a, a, a manpower pool and say okay, look,"
^q,we need somebody
