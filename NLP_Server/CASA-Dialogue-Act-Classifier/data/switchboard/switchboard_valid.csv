"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
qw,how do you keep up with current events?
sd,"um, well actually, usually, uh, in the mornings i am getting ready to either go to work, uh,"
sd,usually catch the news in the morning
b,"yeah,"
qw,what what channel do you watch or what station?
sd,"uh, n b c"
sd,that's the one i watch
sd,i usually keep up with t v
%,"i don't, -"
sd,i am a student
sd,so i really don't have much time to like read the newspapers and stuff 
b,uh-huh
sd, so i get a lot of stuff through the grapevine which is really isn't 
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i usually tend to just, you know, rely on, you know, t v, uh, again, you know, just through the grapevine just, just to know like, you know like what today's stories are"
sd,and i usually like go out an buy a newspaper if you know i'm interested in any particular one
b,yeah
sd,the radio doesn't really have much news sometimes
sd,the stations i listen to are just mainly music
b,"yeah,"
sv,i think you pretty much have to listen to all news station to get any news at all
b,yeah
qy,"do you think that t v is, uh, pretty accurate"
qy,i mean sometimes do you think it gets pretty commercialized
%,"or, -"
no,"well, what i really don't like about t v, especially local news as compared to like national news is just, uh, it seems, it seems like everything is very spoon feed"
sv,"and you know it's, it's more like the news shows is now is now you know an entertainment show like a sitcom "
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
%,it's -
sd,they mainly go with like popular topics 
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"also, also i have the observation of, uh, with the press is that, like any any stories that i had any first hand knowledge of that i see in the press, you know, which only happened like ten times in my life "
b,huh
b,yeah
sd, it's something wrong
%,"going, -"
sv,"they're, looks like they're going more for ratings than for "
b,uh-huh
sv,"i think, you know the probably the best source of just plain journalism would be newspapers "
b, uh-huh
sv, they typically have a better -
sd,i am from a small town too here in texas 
b,uh-huh
%,"and, -"
b,"yeah,"
^2,the farm report
aa,"yeah,"
sd,farm report and oil reports
ba,that's pretty pretty sad
sd,or who killed who
b,uh-huh
sd, also i have found that newspapers probably aren't as bad as television 
sd,read the story and just found it so incredibly watered down
%,"and, -"
b,yeah
sd,"well, in, uh, in dallas, i don't know if you heard about the killing where the guy drove into luby's"
sd,"and the story was, uh, -"
qy,"was that like he started shooting people, people in this cafeteria or something?"
ny,yeah
sd,and the news covered it 
b,uh-huh
sd,and they were taping people who were crying who 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and then like three days later this, uh, local news station was using as as their promo "
b,uh-huh
sv,"i just thought that was really that's kind of cold, "
b," oh yeah,"
sd,i have seen that happen lots of times
sd,"you know, uh, channel x gives you the best coverage "
sd,you know we were on the scene with our team players
%,"and, -"
b,yeah
%,"and it was just, -"
sd,they were showing like these dead people 
b,uh-huh <<very faint>>
sd, and they were showing people crying 
b,uh-huh <<very faint>>
sv, i mean just taking advantage of you know -
b,uh-huh
sv," they are trying to get the, you know, most emotional response for, -"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"it didn't seem like there was much coverage of the story,"
sd,but just the play on people's emotions 
%,"it's just gotten so, -"
sv,"i mean, somewhere there's, it's lost a lot of the quality that they use to have like in walter cronkite that if you know -"
b,yeah 
sv, and everything -
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"you know, i've pretty much stopped watching local news totally you know "
b,yeah
sd," uh, you know even the national news i just find it to be you know "
b,yeah
%,"very, -"
qo,what did you think of the coverage of the war?
sd,"uh, i fou-, i found it very one sided"
bh,did you?
sv,"uh, you know, it, it just seemed to lack any sort of debate"
b,yeah
h,"uh, you know, not saying that we shou-, that we actually should have been there or shouldn't have been there,"
sv,"but it just seemed like, you know -"
sv,"they kept just showing, you know, how great we were doing"
sv,and it never really showed what actually 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv," a lot of times like the news coverage showed all the, you know, the guys who didn't get hurt coming home and all the big parties "
b,uh-huh
%," and they kind of you know, -"
qh,if they were going to show that why didn't they show the guys who 
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sv,"and i really think that you know in the involvement that the press states, you know that the the military basically sets the press,"
sv,"-ing seems to be a, a topic that's going to probably take about a generation to, uh, catch on, it seems, or maybe a generation to two "
sv,and we may have to do it out of necessity as far as moving that time schedule up
sv,"uh, it does seem to be a lot of habits to break"
sd,"i, uh, wasn't raised as a kid on it,"
sd,but my kids are
sd,"and so they, they tended to want to grab the aluminum cans when that was one of the first things to do,"
sd,"and we were doing all right there until, uh, the price dropped out"
sd, and they weren't worth anything anymore
b,uh-huh
%,"and we , -"
sd,"it took us, almost a year to get a garbage sack full"
sd,we just don't drink that many
sd,"so as far as at home use, uh, we'll pick up a six pack every once in a while or for whatever occasion of doctor pepper or something"
sd,"and, and by the time we gathered up enough crushed cans to take it in, uh, -"
sd,"at the time it was still, oh, about forty or fifty cents a pound,"
sd,"and we came out with about a dollar ,"
sv,it just really wasn't worth it
bf,and a lot of hassle all year round
bf,"and cans laying, -"
aa,yeah
b^m,yeah
sd,"so, they, they realized, you know, -"
sd,"well, of course to them a dollar was a dollar at four and five years old"
sd,"that wasn't, uh, that was a big deal,"
sd,but we decided it wasn't worth us keeping it
sd,"and then, uh, t i started keeping up with, uh, cans there,"
sd,so occasionally i'll bring whatever i've got laying around the car or the like and throw them in there
sd,"least it gets back into the system,"
sd,"but, as far as a habit at the house, uh, i haven't started on anything other than just whatever the city wants to pick up"
qy,have you all got the individual containers yet?
nn," no,"
sd,"i read in the paper this week where maybe, -"
h,"i don't know if it w-, was, -"
sd,i guess maybe this week someone may start getting them if the truck that picks them up is outfitted in time
%,um
sd,"but, it, it should be starting, i would stay probably in the next month if, if everything goes that , -"
sd,"i'm not sure all what we're going to have to do, whether we have three separate containers,"
sd,i really don't understand that part on what they've told you to separate everything
b,right
b,"yeah,"
sv,"it seemed like, uh, -"
sd,"if, if i recall, it's been a long time"
sv,they're way behind schedule on that particular part of it
sv,"they were fine on the green, big green containers "
b,uh-huh
sv," but, uh, seems like they said they were just going to have a bin"
sd,and all different types would go in there
sd,and then that they would sort it as 
b,oh
sv,"it, it seemed that there was, -"
sd,"at the time anyway, it, the thinking was that there was too much not getting sorted properly and that at, at the collection sites where everything's clearly labeled and people that happen to go to that kind of trouble to do it, happen to do it pretty well, uh, those are okay to have the general public doing the sorting"
sd,"but when it comes down to just general purpose trash, that all the houses, uh, -"
sd,"the success rate of getting it sorted properly seemed to be poor,"
sd,"so they felt that having one guy just sit there and run through it real quick was better than, than "
b,uh-huh
h,"but i, i don't know,"
sv,that sounds like an awful lot of labor to sort the entire week's worth of trash for a house
sv,"well, it would get messy, too"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i, i, i know other places when they recycle, they have to, like, wash out their glass jars and "
b,right
aa,that's true
sd,"i was brought up, uh, you know, long time ago, that they didn't even have cans"
sd,they had bottles
sd,and you'd return them to the 
b,right
sd,and you'd get our money back
sv,"and that, that was all well and good"
sd,they don't seem to still be doing that
sv,"if they could just eliminate the cans and use glass,"
sd,"but, i guess this day and age "
b,yeah
^2, they don't do that
sd,we live next to a set of railroad tracks
sv,"and it seemed to be a very popular thing for people driving by that highway there, by our tracks to throw the bottles at the tracks and try to crash, you know "
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, they weren't that successful,"
sd,so there were a lot of bottles to be returned
sd,and we just walk about a half a mile in each direction and gathered up enough to buy whatever we wanted 
b,uh-huh
%,"and, -"
b,"yeah,"
%,"and they, uh, p-, -"
sv,"i, i think kids don't appreciate, maybe the value of money, that it's so little that they don't care,"
sv,they can get more somewhere else
b,"yeah,"
sv,"just a little bit of begging will , -"
%,"uh, for a good, -"
b,right
%,"they're, -"
sv,"the nickels, the dimes or what, i suppose it might be quarters, fifty cent pieces in these days, that they would get, they, the kids just don't seem to, to care that, that much about a small amount of money"
b,right
%,"well, i wonder,"
sd,"but, we, we did buy a can crusher"
sd,and we are crushing cans
sd,"and when we buy the soda when it's on sale for ninety-nine cents,"
sv,so i would say 
b,yeah
sv,"uh, it was just easier to do that than to open a large liter bottle and then have it go flat"
b,"right,"
b,yeah
sd," so that's the main reason we're, we, sort of are into cans at this point rather than the liter bottles "
qw,where do you take your cans?
^h,"well, as you say, it takes a while to build it up"
sd,"since we've had the crusher all summer, we , i guess we just now maybe have a bag full that we haven't ta-, oh, -"
sd,"i think the kids, when we were on vacation, they said they did take them to a, a recycling place, probably at one of the li-, -"
ad,"well, basically, uh, did you want to go first, then?"
aa,"uh, well, i can"
sd,"i, i don't own my home"
b,"okay,"
b,right
sd,"uh, i mean i, i live in a nice area"
sd,and i rent my home
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
b,"sure,"
b,uh-huh
%,"so, -"
b,yeah
sd,"i think as far as, like, our home, it's, uh, in a small residential area"
sd,"we're out of the cities quite a ways,"
sd,so it's kind of more of a country setting
sd,"and, uh, it's just a typical, uh, three bedroom type of home"
sd,"it's, it's nothing, you know, elaborate where it has, uh, this or this or, you know"
sd,"it's, it's "
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, and i think as far as if it's, for put it into standards of, uh, what other homes are around here, it would be just about fitting right into the middle part of where the homes are"
sd,"uh, there's a river across from us which has more elaborate homes"
%,"and yet there's, -"
sd,"where we can view the river from that distance, there's still homes within our area that are, you know, pretty typical of what our home is,"
sd,so 
b,uh-huh
%,"so, -"
b,yeah
sd,"well, our ho-, "
sd,and he lives in korea
bh,"oh, really?"
sd,"and, uh, he's recently moved here"
sd,and he's owns eight or nine properties 
b,sure
b,uh-huh
%," and, uh, so, -"
b,yeah
b,"oh, yeah,"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,and they're not very expensive either
sd,"it just seems like, -"
sd,we have a three bedroom house
sd,ours is one level only
b,uh-huh
%,"uh, but we, -"
qy^d,so it's the rambler style
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"we have two, two living areas and a dining room and a big kitchen"
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
%,"so, -"
sd,it's kind of like what ours is
sd,"uh, one of our bedrooms is really small"
sd,"and we've made that into a den because we only have one child,"
sd,"so that was our best way of going with, uh, the small bedrooms because they are making bedrooms smaller and smaller"
sv,it seems like they get incredibly small 
b,yeah
%,"uh, but, uh, anyway, but, okay"
sv,"so that sounds great,"
sd,"and, uh, i don't know if we need to talk any more or whatever"
qy,"have you d-, have you done this before?"
qy,the t i?
ny,uh-huh
ny,"uh, yes,"
sd,"uh, about three times before"
bh,"oh, have you?"
sd,"i'm fairly new to it,"
sd,but it seems to be going okay
b,yeah
qy,are you in texas?
nn,"no,"
nn,huh-uh
b^m,"no,"
b,"yeah,"
nn,"no,"
sd,i'm out of state
sd,"i'm in wisconsin,"
%,"so, -"
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,yeah
b,oh
%,"so it's, -"
ba,sounds interesting
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc"," uh, other than that, sure, yeah"
qy,is this your first time?
nn,"no,"
nn,huh-uh
sd,"i've, well, i've gotten several calls"
b,uh-huh
%,"uh, but, uh,"
sd,i'm always the one that initiates the calls because i kind of like it because it's like i can get it done with 
sd,"i don't have to wait until somebody calls me even though i have a feeling what's going to happen is i'll probably get tons of calls, you know, so, sooner or later"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"well, they've, i've talked to some people from cleveland"
sd,and i did talk to someone 
%,"uh-, -"
b,uh-huh
sd,so 
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
b,sure
sv,"they're, they're sure getting their people out,"
fc,"so, well "
fc,yeah
fc,"and, -"
fc,"okay,"
fc,"well, you take it easy, gail"
fc,"okay,"
fc,thanks
fc,"bye, now"
fc,bye-bye
sd," well, we're just starting a family through adoption"
sd,"so i don't really have a lot of, uh, concrete, uh, opinions"
sd,"just what i know out of my peer group, uh, has gone through"
sv,and none of it has been good 
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,yeah
sd,"uh, the ones that can afford to have live-in nannies,"
b, huh 
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, but a lot of the other ones that have, are professional, uh,"
sv,"i'd say fifty percent of, you know, my peers that i'm, in my circle of friends have tried it and then stopped working until they're, you know, going to get their children in kindergarten or first grade"
b,uh-huh
%,"uh, but i, -"
sv,there must be some good service out there if you 
b, right 
qw,"what, what age child are you thinking in terms of?"
qy^d,in terms of what they're talking about
nn,no
sd,"for, for yourselves "
b,oh
sd,infant uh 
bk,"oh, okay"
b, infant 
sv," so you're starting from the b-, from the baseline"
aa, yeah
sd,"after eleven years of marriage yeah, we are"
sd,"we're actually, it's happening now"
sd,"so, we're just going through the process"
b,i see 
sd,"so an-, and actually the question is, uh, very appropriate"
sd,"cause i'm not sure whether, uh, how strong the maternal instinct is going to be"
sd,they tell me it's going to be strong 
qy, do you 
b, right 
sd,i have one son
qy,and did you put him in daycare
qrr,or is he older now or younger
%,or? -
sd,"well, he's, he's now eighteen and in, in, you know, has completed a couple of years of university"
b,sure
sd,so he's out of daycare 
%," i, -"
b,right 
%,"and, and so that, -"
sd,"but i was working full-time, uh "
b," you, -"
b,uh-huh 
sd,"but i was very lucky because i was a, a college professor"
b,oh
sd,"and so i was able to, you know, "
sd,"and i, it was "
%, flex -
b, yeah 
sd,so i went up there
sd,"and i sort of left him with, with a neighbor"
b,uh-huh
sd,and i left him in a carry cot when he was very little 
sd,"and i said, you know, he doesn't need anything except, you know, look at him if he cries"
sd,"but, you know, don't pick him up and, and "
b, yeah 
sd,because i was gone only an hour at a stretch or an hour and a half
ba,"oh, that's wonderful"
sd,"and i was able to, you know, get, his schedule just, uh, cooperated"
b,right
%,and -
ba,that's wonderful
b, yeah 
b, yeah 
sv,"and, and i guess, uh, th-, because of your, um, your, uh, profession -"
sd,"i mean, i, uh, i'm in corporate communications"
sd,"but i've done free-lance writing in the past,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so what we're hoping is that, uh, -"
sd,i mean my husband thinks i can do it
sd,"i've just never worked out of a domestic base, you know"
sd, i've always 
b, uh-huh 
sd,"uh, but i'm hoping that possibly i can do something where i can go flextime or part-time"
sd,"or if they don't have that, uh, -"
%,"my boss, -"
sd,"i'm very lucky though, again too, my boss is very akin to family building"
sv,"so, i think that's som-, th-, something that couples need in going "
b, uh-huh 
b,right
h,"uh, i don't know"
sd,i do think there's good daycare out there
qw,what part of the country are you in?
sd,i'm in maryland
sd,you're in maryland 
sd," but, but i was out of the country when, uh, my, my son was little"
sv,"but, but the thing is, if you have this flextime and that, you might be able to do something similar to what i did"
b, right 
sd,that's what i'm hoping
sd,"and then later on when he was, you know -"
b,uh-huh
%," i mean this, -"
sd,"we're talking about, uh, i went back to work and, or taught some, some classes like a week after he was born"
ba,"oh, my goodness"
sv, you were 
%, and so -
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,and so that's when i was 
b, yeah 
sd,but then later what i did was i brought a woman into the house
b,uh-huh
b,sure
sd,"and she, she was supposed to help me a little bit with cooking and doing the baby's laundry and this sort of stuff"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and then, i also came home and sort of was able to see from a distance what she was doing"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, you know, in a sense she, she carried him around a lot, too much uh, you know "
b,uh-huh
b,right
sv,"it was constantly, no, i don't want him, "
^q,"he might, uh, he might hurt himself "
qy," so do you think that, i mean, do you think that that was in a way though, good ob-, good objectivity that, that doesn't really, -"
sd,that's not a correct english 
qy^d,"but , you know "
qy^d,"from a mother's standpoint, i mean in a way, i-, it was quote and unquote good ob-, objectivity"
na,"i think it worked out very, very well"
sd,because what he learned to do by the time he was 
b,uh-huh
b, see -
b,uh-huh
sd,"and he had asked for a paper and, you know, sort of scribble"
sd,and then he realized that there 
b, yeah 
sd,and there were active times
b,right
sd,"and then he learned he, he also learned that, uh, there were times that you had to be gone, so you probably minimized, -"
sd,"well we're actually, uh, we're getting ready"
sd,"i mean, you're far enough away now i can tell you since this is locally, i make sure, we're going to romania in a few weeks"
b,oh
%,"and that's, uh, just -"
qy, did you say romania 
sd,"r-,"
bk,"oh, okay"
b," yeah,"
b,yeah 
sd," as in, like, what twenty twenty and, uh, but we, we're real excited because we've just developed a contact"
ba,"oh, good"
sd,and it's private
sd,and it's hospital
sd,"it's, we're just very excited "
^h, uh 
ba, oh great
sv,"when you deal with issues like that, uh, in terms of family building through adoption, uh, and then you have people responding to you, well if you go through that why would you put them in daycare"
bd,oh that's silly 
sd," uh, issues are being raised prematurely in my mind"
sd,but i guess they're not because it's something i'll have to deal with sooner than later
sd,"uh, and i, what i've learned to do is just tune out everybody's opinion"
sd,"i feel that if the child is healthy, uh, and as long as we make it feel secure, i'd love to do something like with what you did"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, i don't think i could be dumper where i could take it from, you know, eight in the morning till nine at night or six at night and leave it there"
b,right
sd,"uh, maybe after two or three or, y-, years old"
h,i don't know um
%,"oh, i , in my opinion, it's even than -"
sv,i mean 
b, yeah 
sv,"well, they need a schedule i think"
sv,"i don't think the united states, -"
qw,"what country were you, uh, in europe when you were uh, uh? -"
ar,"no,"
sd,i was in the middle east
%,"uh, that's -"
sv,"well, that's the same thing"
h,i mean i don't know how they are there
sd,"but, uh, in eastern europe, -"
sd,"my stepfather's from england,"
sv,"it just seems the united states does not provide for either child care or geriat-, or elder care, as i call it"
b,"right,"
b,right
sv,"uh, and we're just not set up for that"
%,"uh, with the -"
%," i, -"
b,yeah 
ad,go ahead
ar,"no,"
sd,"i was just going to say, i guess, uh, my sensitivities are, are much more with the, you know, to be at home"
sd,"because actually, i had "
b,uh-huh
ba,"see, i think that's wonderful"
sd,"and, i mean, that was recently after my son, was going off"
%,"and i mean, yes,"
sd,"in a sense, i went to work"
sd,and she was at home alone some of the time
sv,"but, but still, you know, it was much better than being shipped to "
%, to -
b,right
sv,"i think we're t-, we're too, too much towards it's somebody "
^2, we cast off 
b," right, "
b, right
%,"th-, -"
sd,i'm that way
%,yeah 
^q, i want to work
^q,"shove them in, in some school for twelve hours a day"
b,right
sv,it's easier
sv,and i agree with that
%,that's why i 
b,yeah
sv,what is amazing to me is now your son is already grown
sv,but you can probably empathize with this
sd,it's amazing to me how forthcoming people are with their opinions and thoughts 
b,"right,"
b,right
sd,"in terms of what to do uh,"
sv,"and i just don't think there is a day, a good daycare system"
sd,"uh, my company, i'm particularly fortunate that they have, they're in tune with that"
sd,"but i've been at companies where, uh, you know, the, deci-, the, the trend is, or the definite mood is, well we made conscious decisions not to have children"
%,you know
%,"and in, -"
sd,"and a couple like us building through adoption, there, it's almost radical to some people"
sd,and what you just learn to do is tune everybody else out
sd,"and, uh, i respect, there are some women that i know that are divorced or on their own or in single parenting and men that they, you know, they may have the need for child care like that"
b,uh-huh
ba,"but i agree with you, that it's just, i call it dumping "
b,yeah
%,"i, i -"
b," no,"
sv," i, i think that certainly there is a role, uh, for this type of help"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, and as long as one can, can supervise it and, and, you know, make it work in, into one's own schedule without it seeming like dumping or "
b,uh-huh
^2,"then, yeah,"
sv," it's ar-, "
b,"yeah,"
b, yeah
%," i just, uh, -"
sd,and there are trade-offs too i think
sv,"one of the things that is a problem is that, uh, in terms of compensation to some of the child care providers"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, it's just, you know, it's so low"
sd,"but yet the overall cost for somebody doing it on a daily or even a weekly basis, it's prohibitive"
sd,and some people that are not making more than twenty thousand a year 
b,yeah
sd,"actually, there seems to be an alternative in my neighborhood"
%, is -
b, really 
sv," there seem, there are several, u-, u-, m-, mothers who stay home"
b,uh-huh
%,"and they take, you know, -"
sv,it's probably not completely legal 
%,"uh, i, -"
sv,maybe it's legal up to one or two additional kids
b,sure
sd,"but, and they, they take care of another child"
sd,"and i, i can actually n-, could name five or six people around my neighborhood that really do a good job on this"
b,uh-huh
%," and they, -"
b,yeah 
sv, and i mean that's another possibility
sv,"and, you know, you might want to stay home one year"
sv,"and some other lady might want to stay home for a, a few years"
%,and -
sd,i haven't thought about that
b,yeah
sd,and actually my neighbor has an eighteen month old
sd,and she's at home part-time paralegal
%,"so i'm thinking, um -"
b," yeah,"
b,yeah 
sd,and we get along fantastically
%,"so i'm thinking, you know -"
sv,"and that's the way you have to, uh, -"
%,"how wa-, -"
sd,i'm just real curious
qo,how was the middle east in terms of that with children?
qy,"is that, is child care or that type of idea completely foreign to them?"
nn,no
sd,"well, actually there was a daycare center, uh, where my son did go for a year"
sd,i think from when he was two to three
b,uh-huh
sd,but then he actually started kindergarten at age three
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so, and i-, you know, it wasn't like prekindergarten,"
sd,it was real kindergarten
b,"oh, really"
sv,he must be smart
b,yeah 
aa, yeah
sd,"so he, he was ready to, to go to school at that point"
b,uh-huh
ny,"but, yeah,"
sd,"they're, they do have such facilities"
sv,"but for the most part, uh, th-, with the extended family, you know, you can usually find somebody which is much like our neighbor "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i'm, and also there aren't that many women who, who d-, who work "
sd, the professional 
b,"yeah,"
sd,i was wondering about that 
b, yeah 
%,"uh, there, -"
sd,i'm in dallas
sd,"and there was just a very big, uh, series about moslem women"
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
sd,i'm digressing here
qy^d,"but, uh, i was just real curious when you said middle east, if you "
b, yeah 
nn,"no,"
nn,no
sd,and i didn't mean israel
qy^d,"so you, you assumed right "
nn," oh, no"
bd,that's okay 
sd," well, even if you did, that's okay actually"
%, i think -
arp_nd," well, no "
sd,"because at first thought, when i s-, you know, i said that not many people work, i'm, i'm thinking oh, well she's going to, you know, because certainly in israel the women do work "
b, right
b,right
sd,"they fight,"
sd,they work 
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
b^m,okay
sd,i forgot all about that that it had to be pressed
%,"um, but anyway, so, so as far as, -"
sd,"w-, we really, we don't want to get in the habit of watching a lot of t v "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,and we just don't want that
sd,"we want more communication and interaction, you know, amongst us as a family"
sd,"and we both like sports,"
sd,"so we figured, well what, what better way to get out and, you know, be together as a family "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and plus, we like, we both like to cook,"
sd,"so, you know, that's something we spend time together too, is, you know, cooking and, uh, preparing meals and stuff"
sd,"so, uh, but as far as that , that's about all we've discussed as far as for family "
b," really,"
b,"okay,"
sd,"well see, i'm the third oldest of twelve children"
ba,oh my gosh
%,"so like i said, i, -"
sd,and i'm only twenty-one
sd,i'll be twenty-two next month
sd,so there's nine that are younger than me
sd,my youngest sister is five
b,oh yeah
sd,"and like i sa-, i don't have any children"
sd,"i'm just engaged,"
sd,"and i'm getting married in october,"
sd,and we haven't discussed this at all um
b,"yeah,"
qy^d,"long way down the road, right"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,exactly
sd,"but, um, now i've noticed that like, while i'm at college, and when i go home, my bro-, you know, my, -"
sd,"i'm really close to the younger ones,"
sd,"and, um, like, when, when, like when i do go home they enjoy just laying around me, you know,"
sd,"like if we do watch t v at night, they just like enjoy just, like laying on top of me or something"
b,yeah
sd,they like that
sd,"but, um, as far as that goes, like we play games,"
sd,"i play like old maid and fish with them,"
sd,"and w-, we play board games,"
%,"and when it's ni-, -"
sd,"like i'm from pennsylvania,"
sd,"so when it's nice out, we go outside,"
sd,and we like to play like kick ball and softball and stuff
b,uh-huh
sd,"and in the summer everyone is like, i think there's like seven of us still at home,"
sd,"and all seven are in a sport,"
sd,like also the girls are in softball
sd,and the boys are in baseball
sd,"so all summer we live on hamburgers and hot dogs and sports,"
sd,"that's it, you know"
%,"well do you, do you, -"
qy,"so you go, if you're, if you're not doing any kind of sport thing you go to one of your sisters' or brothers' "
b,uh-huh
ny,yes
na,"right,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,we go and watch
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sv,"well, that's, that's good, too, i mean, as far as entering,"
sv,"i mean, you're, you're participating,"
sv,"but you're not, you know"
b,uh-huh
sv,i mean at least you're encouraging them on and stuff
%,"and that's, -"
b,yeah
sd,"because, um, even if our kids, you know, get into sports that we're really not interested in, i don't, i want them, you know, to know that we're still there "
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, it's funny because, um, well, my mom and dad both were kind of athletic"
sd,"they both grew up on a farm,"
sd,"but although, you know, it wasn't them playing i notice like whenever i was playing softball and such, my mom and dad got into it more than i did"
sd,"i mean, they'd be in the audience screaming and yelling, you know,"
%,so -
b, yeah
bf,cheering you on and stuff 
sv,"a lot of times the parents get into it just as much as, as the kids,"
sd,"and i found, like a lot of times like when we went on to tournaments and stuff, it was really funny because the crowds would like get into argu-, you know, get into fights, who can scream louder, and you know, everything"
sd,"so it's really pretty funny to see my parents get into it,"
sd,and they're not really even participating
b,"yeah,"
sv,"well, that, that would be fun"
bf,"boy, so you, you have a lot of experience as far as, you know, different ways a family can interact and, and do things together,"
aa,yeah
%,"go-, -"
%,twelve
aa,uh-huh
%,but it's -
%,"so, if you're not, -"
%,"i-, -"
%,"what if, -"
qy,do people go off in their own little groups with that many?
qy,"i mean, did like some people go to their rooms and , -"
ny,"yeah,"
%,"it's, um, -"
sd,"the, the one down thing about having that many people in our family is you real-, we really don't have any privacy when we're at home, because you couldn't possibly have a house with twelve bedrooms"
b,yeah
sd,"but, um, like i say, you know, i'm twenty, i'll be twenty-two next month,"
sd,and i'm closer to the younger kids than i am the ones my own age
sd,"and that's, i think,"
b,huh
sd,"and the younger kids are at home,"
sd,and i like to spend time with them
b,yeah
qw,"but when you were growing up and they weren't, and the younger ones weren't around, what did you do?"
arp_nd,we were all pretty close when we were younger
bk,"oh, i see"
qy^d,"but now that they've all sort of moved off, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"now that we're getting older, people are get-, you know, each one of us are going our own direction"
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
%,"so, do you think, even, -"
qw,"i mean, what did you do when you were younger,"
qy,"did you go do the board games and stuff,"
qy,you still did what you do now
ny,"oh, yeah"
sd,"and, um, we, you know, we had blocks and stuff,"
sd,"and we just did, we would make, -"
sd,"like in the winter when it wa-, -"
sd,we couldn't go outside because of the snow and stuff 
b,uh-huh
sd," we, uh, we would, um, clear out our basement,"
sd,"and we would like, do, just, even stupid things,"
sd,"like we try hurtling our couches and stuff you know, and -"
qy^d,hurling
ny,"yeah,"
sd,we would just run and jump over the couches
bk,"oh, hurtle,"
bk,"oh, okay"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"to see who could jump over, you know"
sd,we just made up our own stupid little games
sd,"and like hide and seek,"
sd,"well, we have a, a bigger house than a lot, you know,"
sd,our house isn't the average small one
sd,so we could like play hide and go seek in our house and even stuff like that
bf,"so you, you had a lot of games and things you played "
aa,yeah
sd,"well see, they're, um, we're all, like we're all pretty close together"
sd,"like, m-, my sister that's closest to me, we're only fourteen months apart"
b,yeah
sd,"so there was always, there was never just one alone, you know"
b,"yeah,"
bf,"no, not real spread in age"
aa,right
sd,"so we were all pretty close where we, we always had a buddy to play with,"
b,yeah
ba,"gosh, twelve,"
qy,"is that, is that pretty common up there, uh, in, -"
nn,"no,"
nn,"no,"
sd,not at all
bk,"oh, okay"
sd,not at all 
sd,"i don't meet, i mean, i don't speak with many people that come from families that large any more"
sd,i mean 
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, i mean, that's his mother "
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, and their catholic *they're"
%,"and, i mean that's, -"
b,"well, yeah,"
sd,i'm catholic 
sv,"well that's it then, i think,"
sv,"probably maybe that, that -"
b,uh-huh
qy,"but, i mean, do you see yourself having thirteen kids "
nn,"no,"
sd,not at all
sd,not at all
b,yeah
sd,"but, see, um, when i was younger i used to say that i would like to have five"
sd,"well, i've even cut that down now,"
sd,"and, um, but to me five wasn't even a lot, because i was just so used to twelve"
b,yeah
b,you know
sv," but it's so expensive, man"
aa,"but, yeah,"
sv,"it's so, it would be really hard now to have twelve children"
sv,"i would think for your parents it would be, it would still be hard even nowadays, i mean, just to raise twelve kids"
sd,"well,"
sv,"would be, shoosh"
sd,"and he put himself through college,"
sd,"and, um, there's a sister older than me,"
sd,"she's still living at home,"
sd,but she works 
b,yeah
sd,"and i think she even gives mom and dad a little bit, you know, of rent money"
b,yeah
sd,"and i'm putting myself through college,"
sd,"and like i'm getting married in october,"
sd,and my fianc3e and i are paying for most of the wedding
sd,"and then, then my brother right behind me, he moved out,"
sd,"and he has an apartment,"
sd,"and he works,"
sd,"and then the next one down is in the marines,"
sd,and he's out of the house
sd,"so, it's kind of like they don't, you know -"
sv,"well sometimes i think maybe the larger families create more independence in the children though, you know"
sv,i mean 
aa,"i, i think they do"
b,uh-huh
sv," so you, you kind of have your own independence on going out and getting it yourself,"
aa,exactly
sd,"like, uh, well, i find it a lot when i'm up here at college because i've always had a bank account,"
sd,i've always had my own checking account since i was in like tenth grade
b,uh-huh
sd,"you know, i would work in the summer,"
sd,"and there's a lot of kids up here that would have no idea how to even do a checkbook or, you know,"
b,yeah
sd,"like my roommate's laughing at, you know, at me, you know, because their schooling's paid for "
%," or manage money or know, -"
%," yeah,"
qh,"know, you know, how to get, how to even go about getting money"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,uh-huh
qh,"you know, how to get a job or you know, just what, you know, what, when you get a job, what your responsibility is"
b,yeah
qh,"are you going to blow all that money,"
sv,how easy it is to blow money you earn
aa,yeah
sd,"and see, and then, my mom and dad, like whenever, like we would go out and we would get a summer job, -"
sd,"and then we would start blowing money,"
sd,"and my mom said, well that's stupid for you to be blowing money"
sd,"she goes, okay if your going to blow your money on other things, she goes, you can just pay for your life insurance"
sd,"so then we, when we all graduated from hi-, college, from high school,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"we're still, like i'm still covered under my mom and dad's life insurance because i'm still in school,"
sd,"but i have my own policy, too"
%,"so i had a poli-, -"
sd,"you know, my mom and dad got it set up, you know, you know, helped me to get it and everything,"
sd,"and i have my own policy,"
sd,and then i pay for my own life insurance too
sv,"wow,"
sd,and then 
b,yeah
sd,"because my mom said, that's silly to let one of the older one's drive it,"
sv,"if we were in a wreck, you know, you can be sued for anything now"
sd,and she said that's really not fair to the younger kids
sv,if we were careless and was in a wreck and they got sued -
sv,"and then they can take everything away from my mom and dad,"
sv,and the little kids would have nothing
aa,"and i, i agree with her"
h,"you know, i just, i don't know"
b,yeah
%,"wh-, -"
sd,"so if, you know, if we want to drive, we pay our own insurance,"
%,and -
sv,"so really, i think, sometimes there's an advantage,"
sv,"i mean, sometimes it's good to have a bigger family because it does make you more independent"
b,uh-huh
sv,it makes you know that you can't take anything for granted 
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
h,"so, um, i don't know,"
%,"sometimes, -"
sv,"but now, it, it is hard, i can imagine, on your parents, you know "
ad,why don't you tell me about your choir
b,oh
aa,"okay,"
sd,"well, we, uh, are a group of, uh, musicians that just kind of have, you know, formed out of a desire to sing"
sd,"and many of the people in the group are very professional in the sense that they, or just real talented i should say"
b,uh-huh
sd,"lot of them are former music teachers or currently teaching uh,"
%,"others have, -"
sd,"there's one gal that's in the, uh, plano community orchestra uh, "
sd,"just, you know, different backgrounds"
sd,it's been really kind of interesting
ba,great
%,"so, -"
sd,"uh, i play the piano "
b,um
sd," and, uh, i have a four year old who, who has started to play the piano"
sd,"he does that, uh, musically, listens"
sd,"and then he can play, which is kind of interesting"
b,"oh, yeah"
sv,"i think it's because he's always heard music in our home all the, since he was a baby"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, my husband and my other son, who's eleven just got through singing in a musical here, in, in the community at music man"
bh,"oh, they did?"
qy,"yeah,"
sd,and that's 
qw,"how did,"
sd,"uh, basically they read in the newspaper that there were open auditions"
sd,it was the plano repertory theatre
b,uh-huh
sd,and so they went and tried out
sd,and my husband played harold hill from the music man
sd,and my son played one of the children in a band
ba,"oh, how fun"
aa,"so, yeah,"
aa,"it was really fun,"
sd,"and, uh, my son plays the clarinet in his band at school,"
sd,"and my daughter takes piano lessons, too"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, we just really like music"
sd,"it's a, i, i especially like it as an outlet when the t v goes off,"
sd,we 
b,"um, uh-huh,"
b,um
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
ba,that's nice
qy^d,you say have your four year old taking lessons already?
ny,uh-huh
qw,"and, uh, who do you have her, or him, take it from?"
sd,"uh, i have him take from a friend of mine who teaches suzuki"
b,uh-huh
sd,"you listen to the music and then learn to play it by lear-, by hearing the intervals and things like that"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i teach, uh, like what is traditionally taught, you know,"
sd,you look at the note on the page
sd,"and you play what's on the piano,"
sd,but he can't learn like that
sd,he's a delayed child
sd,"he's only about, i guess he's about two and a half in his real understanding of things"
b,oh
sd,"and, uh, so when my friend played something on the piano and he played it, uh, with his right hand,"
sd,"we went, wow "
b,uh-huh
^q," we better have him do s-, do something"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,so that was really fun
%," well, because my, -"
sd," my husband and i love to go to the musicals downtown, though"
br,pardon me? 
sd," so, my husband and i love to go to the musicals when they come into town "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, i have an eight and a half year old daughter who's taking piano lessons and started out at the age of just turning five "
b,um
sd," because she wanted, you know, she just seemed to enjoy it so much"
sd,"and now my, my four year old, four and a half year old daughter is, is trying to imitate her older sister and wanting to play"
sd,and she actually does some very nice chording just naturally
%,"she just, -"
sv,"oh, i think that's great"
sd,so i wasn't sure when to start her
sd,"i didn't want to push her too early, either, but, uh, kind of had a mixed feelings about that scene"
sv,"that's really hard i think, because, especially if you start them"
sv,and then they get pretty good
sv,"and then they get close, ten, you know, eleven or something,"
sv,"they go, i don't want to do this anymore"
sv,and you're like 
b,uh-huh 
b,yeah
qh,you know
b,yeah
sv,"so sometimes it's hard to, to know exactly when,"
h,"but, i don't know,"
ad,if she acts like she wants to or says she wants to maybe you could have her take some for a while and see how she likes it
aa,"uh-huh,"
aa,uh-huh
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"i think she'd like to,"
%,"i just don't know if it's really, -"
sd,"knowing from what my daughter has gone through, she's, she learned a lot"
sd,"and, of course, it was something she had to keep relearning if she ever got away from it"
b,uh-huh
sd,it was something easily forgotten
sd,"so, uh, i don't know if she's any farther ahead than those kids who started when they were eight"
sd,"or, or should i say seven"
sd,"i mean, she's not a gifted pianist in the sense that she's going to excel just naturally"
sd,"she does have to really work at it,"
%,"but, uh, so, -"
sd,that's like me
b,"yeah,"
sd,"but, so i'm kind of, you know, just playing with it,"
sd,"but at this point we're going to kind of wait, i think just more for the financial reasons of it anyway"
%,"but, -"
sv,"well, it can get expensive "
b,yeah
sv, that's for sure
b,yeah
sd,"i, my friend is, is very generous in, in letting us have my children, uh, do the suzuki method "
b,uh-huh
ba,"oh, that's good"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,so it's been good for our family
qy,"well, as a piano teacher, do you have any feelings for kids who come from a suzuki method,"
qy,have you had any former suzuki students?
ng,"i don't have any suzuki students uh,"
qw^d,"i was wondering how, -"
sd,"something happening to me at christmas time that, that verified to me that i will al-, -"
qy,"well, do you have any pets?"
ny,yes
sd,i do
sd,"i have a dog named grisly, who's a ten year old, uh, mixed breed between golden retriever, afghan hound and chow"
bk,oh
sd,and i have a pair of box turtles
bk,"oh,"
sd,"i used to have box turtles, um, well, years ago, when i was growing up "
b,"yeah,"
sd," i, i really like them"
b,"oh, yeah,"
sd,"i do, too"
sd,"lucky and spot, that's their names "
b,oh
sd," and they live in an aquarium without water in my family room,"
sd,"and my dog thinks he's a mother turtle,"
qy,so do you have any pets now?
ny,"yes,"
sd,"um, we have one dog, a bichon frise"
sd,"um, our friends in houston bred the dogs"
sd,i had never heard of them 
nn,"no,"
sd,i haven't either
sd," they're, um, they're all white"
sd,"and they're small, and, um, and fluffy,"
sd,they don't shed
sd,"i guess they're distantly related to a poodle,"
sd,"but they're not very well known in this country,"
sd,"and they're not, um, high strung or over bred "
b,oh
qw,and how big do they get
sd,"ours is, uh, on the small end,"
sd,"and she's about ten pounds,"
sd,and they range from probably ten to sixteen pounds 
ba,"oh, that's interesting"
sd," and they love people, um, and kids"
sd,"and that was something we were looking for, um,"
sd,"our, our love is golden retrievers,"
sd,"and that's what we had intended to get in houston,"
sd,but we had a small yard and a pool
sd,and knowing how they love to dig 
%,"ye-, -"
sv,"the water,"
%,yes
b,yeah
sd," so, uh, we ended up getting this,"
sd,"and, uh, my son would rather have a golden retriever, though, i think "
b,oh
sd," now he wants a, a good size dog "
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,"well, we've got a good size dog,"
sd,"and we were considering getting a puppy, a small house, lap top dog for him, because he likes other animals and for me, because we used to have a miniature dachshund,"
sd,and i miss 
b,oh
b,yeah
ba,"the kind you have sounds very interesting, though"
sd,"well, they really are, um, they're really sweet dogs"
sd,"we've, uh, we thought probably our neighborhood in houston had more of this breed than any other place just because of, um, the family that had them and, and bred them"
sd,"they had five litters of puppies,"
sd,and 
b,oh
b,uh-huh
%," because, um, -"
qw,and how do you spell that breed?
sd,it's b i c h o n f r i s e
b^m,f r i s e
qw,and how do you pronounce that?
sd,bichon frise
bk,okay
sd,"i'm writing it out phonetically,"
b,yeah
%,"they're, uh, -"
sd,and they don't shed
sv,"so they're, they're good dogs for people with, with "
b,"yes,"
sd,"and they love people,"
%,"and they're, -"
qy,do they bark a lot?
nn,"um, no,"
sd,not really
sd,"ours, um, ours barks more than, um, than some, because she spent a lot of time at our friends' house"
sd,we used to swap back and forth dogs
sd, they have three dogs
sd,"they had a cockapoo, and, and two bichons "
b,uh-huh
sd,and she didn't bark at all until she spent time there 
bk,oh
sd," and, uh, now it's funny"
sd,"she's, she's a good watch dog "
b,uh-huh
sd," and if there's, she'll bark that way,"
sd,"but she also talks a lot,"
sd,she 
b,yes
sd,"and so, if we're leaving her, she barks at us, because "
b,oh
qy,does she ever mess in the house?
nn,"no,"
nn,"no,"
sd,"and they're, um, they're very smart dogs"
sd,the circuses in europe used to use them 
b,oh
sd,"they, uh, oh, they'll dance "
b,uh-huh
ba,"oh, gee"
sd," um, but they're very easy to train "
b,uh-huh
%," and, -"
qw,and about how much are they?
%,"well, they range, -"
^h,i'd noticed up here they're a lot more expensive it seemed to me from the ads in the paper
sd,"they run anywhere from two hundred to four hundred dollars, i think "
qw,"and how about the,"
arp_nd,"well, she's no longer breeding them "
bk,oh
sd," but, um, because her dogs, um, the, the second one that she has was one of the puppies from the litter,"
sd,"and, uh, the one male that she used had a tooth problem "
b,uh-huh
sd, and so she only bred that dog once because it had 
b,"oh, yes"
b,"just pets,"
b,"yes,"
sd,"that's what we'd rather have is just a pet, instead of -"
b,"ri-, -"
sd, we used to show saint bernards when i was a little girl
sd,"we did that every weekend,"
sv,"oh, but, yeah, takes a lot of time"
aa,"yes,"
sv,and it's very expensive
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"um, but she might have some contacts here,"
sd,"i know origina-, i know that the dog's grandmother, um, was from plano,"
sd,"oh, that's where i live,"
sd,"oh, that's where i live, too"
b,"yeah,"
sd,i'm at coit and legacy -
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","so i own a, a p c a t at my home"
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,"i could never justify owning a personal computer at home, uh,"
sv,"i mean, that's quite an expense to look for, uh,"
qw,"well, who is this,"
qo,what do you use yours at home for?
arp_nd,"well, that's actually a good question"
sd,"my wife works out of the home, our home"
sd,she has an office
sd,and in fact she sits in the office
sd,and she uses it to compose and print out letters
bk,"okay,"
%,well now -
sd,so that's a very regular use of it that she has
b,uh-huh
sd,and in addition to that i tinker around with it
sd,i'm a computer scientist
bk,oh
sd,and so i write programs to do little things
sd,i'm actually working on a data base at home just to keep track of things nothing special
sd,and also i'm interested in writing some programs that will kind of like remind me of things like remind me that wednesdays is trash day and the like
sd,"uh, huh, well, excuse me, i, uh, uh, well i'm a technician, electronics tech"
sd,"years ago t i sent me to their, uh, computer school down in austin"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, uh, i learned to repair one"
sd,but you know i never really learned to operate one
sv,"oh, that's a key thing"
%,"well, actually that's a, -"
sv,there's really two issues to that that there's so many software packages available today
aa,yes
%,"so that yo-, -"
sv,in other words when someone built that software packet they had to use the programming
sv,"but if they were careful, they could make the use of it totally without understanding how the computer works"
b,uh-huh
sv,but i think you you really hit the nail on the head
sv,for the average person is exactly what he can use it for
sv,and if your wife isn't working out of the home and sending letters
sv,"or if you don't want to build a data base to keep track of the < > nuts and bolts in your garage,"
sv,whatever
sv,"there, your issue is then there really, -"
sd,"well, uh, space is a handicap with me,"
sd,i live in a motor home
b,"oh, i see"
%,well -
sd,and i'm preparing for retirement
b,i see
ba,"well, congratulations on that"
sd,and i'm not to far from it another year and a half
b,"yeah,"
sv,"well, actually one other thing i might ought to mention is that they are actually getting quite cheap"
aa,"yes,"
aa,"definitely,"
sv,but just like the computers
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, remember how they started out running three, four hundred dollars"
b,right
bf,"oh, the calculators you mean"
na,"i mean ca-, calculators,"
fa,i beg your pardon
aa,"yeah,"
aa,they sure do
aa,yeah
sd,i actually was thinking about upgrading mine very recently and kind of look at the whole spectrum
sv,you can actually buy a whole brand new computer with a not not a necessarily a slow one or inadequate one but a pretty good one for six hundred dollars
bh,you're kidding
nn,no
qy,including a printer?
arp_nd,"well, actually i wasn't including a printer,"
sd,but you you can buy a printer now for a hundred dollars
sd,so make it seven hundred
qy,a hundred?
ny,yeah
ba,"wholly smoke,"
qy,a respectable one?
ny,"yes,"
ny,uh-huh
sd,"well, see of not being particularly interested i don't keep track of prices on them,"
sd,"but i'm, i'm, that does amaze me"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"the prices had plummeted,"
sd,"you can buy the computer the guts just the guts with the power supply,"
b, uh-huh 
b,huh
sd,"and then the keyboard is another fifty,"
sd,the monitor with the card that drives is another hundred
sd,and then the disk drive is two fifty
qy,"well, what, what is a a good brand a inexpensive"
arp_nd,"well, that's that's the deal is you're not buying brands now,"
sd,"you're buying these knock offs,"
%,"so there's, -"
sd,probably the way to do it if you really wanted to buy one is there's a magazine called computer shopper
b,uh-huh
sd,"it's a big magazine,"
sd,"it's twelve inches acro-, narrow, the narrow side and "
ba,"oh, wow"
sd,and it's probably an inch thick a thousand pages
sd,"but the book is, the magazine is full of these mail order, computer mail-order houses"
sd,and they're all competing with each
b,uh-huh
sd,"so you just flip through there until you find a eighty, eighty-eight computer "
sd,"that that's called, it's the original p c"
%,"so it's, -"
sd,"we call the t i, i'm sorry an i b m p c compatible"
sd,and you'll find all these things and you'll find the monitors forty dollars and the card that drives the monitor that goes in the back of the board for twenty-five dollars which is amazing to me
b,uh
sd,and you mix and match
sd,and then you do it by mail-order
sd,but there's no real brands
sd,"it's probably a half a dozen companies around the world that are making those mother boards, the main computer, the circuit board"
bk,i see
qo,how do you go about getting one of those a catalogs?
sd,"they're available in, you know, the b daltons, that that type of thing"
b,uh-huh
sd,"you'll notice that in that it's, it's a, it's a, although it's a magazine it's large"
sd,and like i said it's about an inch thick 
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,"well, getting back to the p c -s,"
^h,"i'll tell you,"
%,"i ya, -"
sd,first of all i don't like a machine that's smarter than me
sd,"and secondly, i did learn this much about computers,"
sd,they they are pretty stupid because they add one and one up and come up with ten
sd,in binary
aa,that's right 
ba,there's great
sd,"well, anyway that's one ever my favorite jokes"
b,"oh, yeah "
sd,one and one equals ten
b,"yeah,"
b,that's great
sv,"course it's it's kind of an inside joke, you know"
b,yeah
sv,you can only tell that to somebody who understands binary
ba," i understand,"
ba,"that's great,"
ba,that's a good joke
%,"so what, -"
qy,"do you, uh, uh, work with a computers a at t i?"
na,i did for years
sd,and then i was a scientist over in central research labs
sd,and just recently i've changed my job to actually do some of the marketing
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, now i i type that one,"
sd,but i don't use it anymore
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,well i just recently started using one
b, uh-huh 
b,yes
sd,"uh, i keep track of an inventory here"
b,uh-huh
sv,and of course now that is where a computer is very handy
aa,"yes,"
aa,i agree
sd,"and, well i, it's my responsibility to see that equipment is sent off to be calibrated"
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,see i'm with the q r a lab
b,"oh, i see"
ba,that's fascinating
sd,"so naturally our equipment has to be in top condition and is constantly calibrated,"
b, uh-huh 
sd, and they're dated
sd,"so i have to keep up with them, uh,"
sd,and and it's very handy doing it on the computer
b,yeah
sd,i just run a printout every week
sd,"and and it puts me right up-to-date what i'm, what i have to do, what i have to ship, what i should be expecting to be returned"
b,uh-huh
%,"so a, -"
sd,it it is handy
b,right
sd,"and i must admit that up until i did start using one, uh, it was, i had very little interest in computers"
b,yes 
sv,but they are amazing
aa,"yeah,"
aa,they certainly are
^h,"so let's see, see"
sv,"so i guess with respect to the question, -"
%,"yeah,"
sv,i guess we've kind of covered it
aa,i think we did
ba,"great,"
fc,nice little conversation with you jack
fc,"yeah,"
fc,mike you take care now
fc, good day 
fc, good luck to you
fc,thank you
fc,same to you
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
b,"all right,"
sd,"well, i'm not a big exerciser,"
sd,but i kind of had to start after i had my baby because i wanted to lose that extra weight
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so basically at this point i'm, i'm a real walker"
sd,"i am, too"
bh,are you?
ny,yes
sd,"i don't do that, oh, i guess i'll call it that fancy type walking where they kind of move their hips, you know, and "
b,uh-huh
sd,i don't do that
sd,"i mostly just take a, a walk around the block or with my baby"
sd,"or, you know, and i have to do that at least once a day if it,"
ba,"oh, that's good"
sd,i can't neglect that because of the baby either
qw,and how old is your baby?
sd,"she just, uh, well, she was premature,"
sd,"so she's about nine months now, though"
sv,"goll-, times goes fast"
aa,yes
sd,"well, i walk two and a half to three miles every night"
ba,"oh, that's great"
sd,my husband and i were on nutrisystem about eighteen months ago 
b,uh-huh
sd, and he lost sixty-two pounds 
sd, and i lost twenty-one
ba,"oh, my goodness"
sd," so we've decided to maintain our weight, that we will do this exercise walking program"
sd,and we walk our dog every night 
b,uh-huh
sd,we have a little path that we do
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
b,exactly
sd," we try to get out, uh, every, every night"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and he plays racquetball twice a week,"
sd,"but i'm not into that,"
sv,so 
sv,"well, i think that is just wonderful"
sd,"now, as far as i'm concerned, i have several other children"
sv,"and so, uh, i think at this point to fit it into, to other things, it's kind of a task"
aa,yes
sd,"you know uh, it's not to where i'm just so freed up that i, i just go, oh, this is wonderful,"
^q,let's go 
aa,"right ,"
aa,that's right
sd,i know my kids are into sports
sd,"and a lot of times, tonight we won't finish with the football game till around nine thirty"
sd,so we will just go out after that
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, my kids, luckily, are old enough i can leave them at home alone while i go out and walk"
b,yeah
qy,"now, does your husband usually go with you, then?"
ny,yes
ba,"oh, see, now that's really nice"
aa,yes
sd,because mine's at meetings sometimes
sd,"and, and he's not really into it"
%,so 
%,no 
sd, my husband never was either until he lost the weight
b,uh-huh
sd,that was his decision
sd,he had arthritis in his hips
sd,and his doctor said he needed to lose weight and exercise
sv,i think that is so wonderful
sd,"so once he got motivated, now he's ready to walk every night"
sd,and our dog has lost a little weight
sd,"he walks every night, too "
sd,"so, he gets excited when he sees us put on our, our shoes, our walking shoes"
ba,i bet
sv,"i think that's really, really good"
sv,"and, and, you know, i think this, after you've done it a certain amount of time, it kind of does get to be a routine"
aa,yes
%,"it's not, -"
sd,"like when i first started, it, you know, that was the hardest thing was "
^2,making time for it
sd,"but now if i haven't done it in a day or two or something, i really notice that i haven't done it in a -"
b,yes
sd,"you know and i like the time because my kids, sometimes they come with me"
sd,and sometimes they don't
sd,"and when they don't, i, i really notice, you know, how fun it can be when they come"
sd,"so, uh, i like to have somebody come with me"
aa,"i know,"
sd,"i do, too"
sd,"uh, i know most of, enough of the people that if anything ever happened i could go to a home "
b,right
sd,"so it, it's not real dangerous,"
sd,"but still, i don't like to go alone"
aa,no
%,so < > -
sd,i never do either even if i have my dog with me
b,yeah
aa,"you know, it's nice to have another person there,"
%,but -
aa,yeah
%,"you know,"
sd,"mostly, it's my husband"
sd,and sometimes it's my kids
sv,"well, i think that's great"
sd,"i, and, well, sometimes when i, i take my kids to the playground that's the only other exercise i, i really think i do"
sd,i was on an exercise program before where it was more like an aerobics type thing
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, i found real quick that wasn't for me"
sd,"me, too"
sd,i did the dance step when i lived up in 
b,uh-huh <<very faint>>
sd,and it just wore me out
sd,i would leave totally exhausted
sd,"i never lost any weight,"
sd,and i got to the point i dreaded going in
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,so walking seems to be a good solution for me
sd,and it doesn't cost anything 
aa,"right ,"
aa,right
sd,and it gives me time to think
sd,"so i think, not only does it help my body,"
sd,but i think it helps my mind 
aa,yes
sd,so i like that
sd,that's the one time in the day my husband and i can get away and talk 
b,uh-huh
aa,"yeah,"
^2,need something
%,"and, -"
aa,yep
sv,they can wait until you get back home
aa,yep

sd,"that's all i do, too"
b,okay
b^m,okay
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","yeah,"
qw,"the question was, uh, what kind of books do you read for entertainment, uh, uh, i guess,"
sd,"oh, i just read for escape"
bk,okay 
%,"well, i mean it's, -"
ba,with two little kids i can understand that
b,yes
sv,it's that's simple
sd,"i read to escape,"
sd,and i don't read any parents magazines either
b,oh 
%,so -
qw,"what, uh, what kind of, -"
sd,"well, i just finished, just, i just finished one last night a great book"
sd,"it, it's very, a typical for my reading though but a great book, one called, the things they carried by tim o'brien"
b,huh
%,"and it's, uh, -"
ba,god
sd,i don't know if i would call it a collection of vietnam war stories or if i'd call it a collection of vietnam love stories
b,oh
sd,strange book beautifully written
b,uh-huh
sd,just beautifully written
qy,"by, uh, somebody who was there"
%,"or, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"a guy who was there as a, uh, foot soldier"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, he considered himself to be, you know, a, a true vietnam soldier"
b,yeah
%,"well, any of the guys that were ground -"
%,yes
%,"yeah,"
ba,i can imagine
b,yeah
qw,"so, what's the latest one you've read?"
^h,"well, i tell you what,"
^h,"i'm a kind of, uh, a history nut"
^h,"i'm trying to think back now,"
sd,"i read an awful lot of, uh, periodicals and, uh, you know, almost what you call reference books"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, the last, uh, i'm embarrassed to say the last, you know, honest to gosh, cover to cover book that i read, i cannot, right offhand, i tried to read, uh, one of the, the michener, uh, lone star or the, the texas history book"
sd,i have never been able to make it through any of michener's work
sd,"oh, well, i've had similar problems"
sv,"it does tend to, to, -"
qy,"have you, are you a civil war buff at all?"
ny,"yeah, as a matter of fact,"
ny,yeah 
sd,"because i finished one,"
sd,"i think this is like two years ago,"
sd,"and somebody had given me one of these dinky do, crappy women's novels set in the civil war, john jakes with , -"
b,yeah
sd,and the novel didn't do that much for me
sv,"but, boy, the period of time was fascinating"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, i then read, was it battle cry of freedom,"
b,<<very faint>> uh-huh
%,"or, -"
%,"yeah,"
sd,i think it was battle cry of freedom
b^m, battle cry of freedom 
sd,"it's kind of like a historical compendium,"
b,yeah
sd,"and it's not a story of the civil war,"
sd,"it's a story of all the politics and, uh, lobbying and just basically state by state events,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and it's fascinating because i had always, you know, been raised on this, you know, emancipation proclamation with the civil war"
b,uh-huh
qy,"there was a lot more to it than that, weren't there?"
na,there was a lot more to it than that
sd,as a matter of fact that was a very minor part that kind of become like an afterthought
b,"yeah,"
sv,"well, it was a political move"
b,"oh, yeah"
sv,"it was made to placate some of the northern support but not completely alienate all the southern support because, you know, it was, uh, if you read it, it only emancipated those who were in areas, uh, in rebellion against the united states"
sv,"all the other areas which would, i think at that time would have included west virginia and, oh, may have been kentucky, a few states, you know, that were not part of the south but still had slaves"
b,uh-huh
sv,they didn't emancipate them
qh,"well, you know what else really surprised me, now"
sd,i'm married to a native texan
sd,and i'm not
b,uh-huh
b,"uh,"
sd,i've got the same problem 
b,"yeah,"
sd,i'm glad you put it that way
sd,and i have two native texan children too
b,yeah
sd,"my husband is always, you know, talked about th-, texas being a, uh, rebel state"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, oh, my god, all this civil war pride"
%,"i kept waiting for, -"
qh,where's some reference to this goddamn state of texas and the role that they played either leading up to or in the civil war
%," mayb-, -"
qy,"isn't much there, was there?"
sv,they might as well have not even been there
b,right
sv,"you know, they weren't a state"
sv,"and the only, the only way that they had any part in it was after worth as to, you know, who's going to be going there"
sd,"and i keep telling my husband that,"
sd,"and he keeps saying, oh, no"
sd,"i thought, okay"
%,"they supplied some, uh, you know, -"
sd,"they were some groups of it, the vicksburg,"
sd,"if you ever get a chance to go over to vicksburg, the battleground at vicksburg, uh, there's an area there where there was, uh, some texas, uh, groups"
sv,and they had an interesting time there
aa,"oh, i'll bet they did"
sd,"and down there at sabine pass, uh, i can't think of the guy's name"
sv,"but he held off, uh, you know, just he and a handful of guys managed to hold off the whole union navy for a while from coming up the sabine river which was of no consequence but still is an interesting story"
qh,"well, you know, why they actually held them off?"
sv,none of the yankees wanted to listen to their kind of luted grammar 
aap_am," that could be it , could be it"
ad,"now, you didn't hear me say that"
%,"outside of, uh, -"
sd,"and then the last civil war battle was fought at val verde, you know,"
sd,"over there on the texas border you had a lot of, of groups heading for mexico"
sd,"and they were cut off at the pass more or less, at eagle pass"
sd,and they didn't get across the river there
%,"so they're, the last, -"
sd,and that was actually after the war was over
sd,"but it was the last,"
b,yeah

b,oh
b,"yeah,"

sd,"oh, well, my sister's living in illinois right now,"
%,so -
sv,"well then, she's going to come out well rounded"
b,yeah
sd,"but outside of those kind of things, you know, the other thing that i've really gotten into reading,"
sd,"and i think this is because the kids are getting to me,"
b,uh-huh
sd,i've always kind of enjoyed it
sd,"i, i used to read a lot more than i do now"
sd,"well, i've gone to the point where my husband, my husband travels, i get out like, you know, two or three books"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i, i'm trying to think of, oh, isaac asimov, robot series"
b,yeah
sd,"i mean, i think i've read all four of them"
sd,and i understand that there's a fifth
b,<<very faint>> uh-huh
sd,in the last six weeks he's been on the road a lot
sd,"i just turned around and looked at my brief, at my briefcase, my, uh, bookcase up here"
sd,and i see armageddon up there
sd,"and, uh, the shadow of blooming grove and two thousand and ten and grant takes command and the war in the year , oh, space that was the one i was trying to wade through was space, james michener didn't get very far on that"
sd,"you know, i think i read hawaii,"
b,yeah
%,or so -
b,yeah
sv,"which is about the developmental level that, you know, you need to be at to read those things,"
sd,"and i still even then i was so, so disgusted with it i, i tried to read, i don't remember which other one it was,"
sd,whatever one it was it was such a blockbuster seller
b,yeah
sd,"and i just, i got about like a hundred pages through it and realized i had like a thousand more,"
sd,"i thought, i can't do this"
b,"yeah,"
%,it really -
sv,"the, the books are kind of, uh, imposing to say the least"
b,yeah
^h,"no,"
^h,"let's see,"
sd,here's one called ghost towns and mining camps of new mexico
sv,"now, not too many people have read that one"

%,"i've got, uh, -"
qy,"is that a big, thick book?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"and i've got, yeah, and i've got a history of kingsley, iowa"
qw,"what the, what the hell for?"
qw,"why kingsley, iowa?"
sd,"well, because that's where my folks all came from"
bk,"oh, okay"
sd, and they had a centennial here awhile back
sd,"i read the grant takes command,"
sd,that was pretty good
%,"well, -"
sd,"that was part of that trilogy that, uh,"
%,"now that's one that,"
h,i don't know
sd,"see, i had never really been into science fiction that much until, uh, somebody gave me mist of avalon probably about five or six years ago"
b,yeah
sd,i don't know if i'd call it science fiction or fantasy
sv,"sometimes it's awful hard,"
sv,some of those get very philosophical
sv,"they can be in any setting,"
sv,"they just happen to put them in a futuristic setting, you know,"
%,"the, -"
sd,"well, i loved that novel"
sd,"and then somebody said, oh, god, this would have been even long ago because i was in boston"
sd,"and it was raining all night,"
sd,and i had a hole in my roof

arp_nd,"um, well, see it's more my grandma that feels that way"
b,<<very faint>> uh-huh
sd,"she says that when her husband died that he said, oh, that my uncle had said that he would never ha-, put her in a rest home"
%,"so it's kind of, uh, -"
h,i don't know
sd,"i mean, i don't, i don't think my parents would"
sd,but she is getting pretty bad
sd,like she has to have like a little toilet right by her bed
%,"and,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and my mom has to take care of her pretty much
%,"so it gets, -"
h,i don't know
sv,"it's, it's a hard decision,"
sd,but i don't think i would do it to my parents personally 
%,"i know at this, -"
sd,"i know i feel like i would never do that with my parents either, you know"
sd,"but i, i really feel bad for the people i see th-, not very, -"
sd,"i'm not really, really experienced"
sd,"but like i said i just have that one family,"
sd,and i just really feel bad for the guy who his whole life is different now
sd,"and, than he thought it would be"
%,"but, -"
qw,when he retired?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"and he's got, you know, seven brothers and sisters"
sd,"and, and, uh, he's the one because he's the one that isn't going to work every day and that she moved in with when she needed to move in with someone"
%,"and, -"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"it's like that good for us just because my uncle and my, and my mom switch off like we have her for three months"
sd,and then he has her for three months
ba,"oh, well, that's great"
sd,"so that,"
ba,that's a good idea
%,"we ought to, -"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"and maybe when the other brothers and sisters retire or whatever, i don't know what they're going to do"
sd,it's really not my family
sd,it's my fiancee's
sd,"so i don't, i can't say much"
b,uh-huh
sd,but i always feel like i would never put my parents in either
sd,"and i wonder, i'm going to be the only sibling that isn't going to have children"
sd,"so if my parents do need to live with someone, it will probably be with me because all my brothers and sisters will be having teenagers around and everything to care for"
bh,really?
%,"and i'm, i, -"
sd,that's fine with me
sd,"i-, my fiancee and i both figure that's what's, we're going to end up with both of the parents or whoever"
%,"if the-, -"
qh,you know what i mean?
sd,"we feel like,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and i feel like i would never put them in a home
sd,"but i wonder how much, you know, if one of us is going to have to quit work someday or retire early or something"
b,uh-huh
sv,you think about it
%,"and it's really, -"
h,i don't know
sv,this country kind of takes the worst care of the elderly of any other country
bh,you think?
sd,"i, i "
sv,"and,"
sv,"and, and they really seem as wise"
sv,"and, and in this country nobody really,"
sv,they're seen as senile 
sv,"and they, oh, the old-timer made with the old way"
sv,and nobody respects the traditions
%,"and, you know, it's i, -"
sd,i'm not saying that i do either
sv,but 
b,right
sv,"and, and we really don't have any that don't have the social security"
sv,and everything really isn't that much 
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, even if they're in good health it's incredible"
b,right
sv,"they don't have any, -"
sv,"they don't get special treatment and maybe they should, you know "
b,uh-huh
aa,i know
sv,"and so it's a, it's kind of a depressing topic though"
qw,how old are you?
sd,"um, i'm twenty"
qy^d,"so it is, yeah, and it must be rough for you too to see your grandmother"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"it's,"
sd,"but, and she, she drives us craz-,"
qw,what do you like to watch on television ?
sd,"well, i guess a lot of the, uh, -"
sd,something that's kind of more of a comedy
sd,"we do have, uh, cable,"
sd,"and we have premium stations like h b o and showtime and such,"
sd,"and i guess a lot of times when i first turn the t v on, i, i normally go to those, because i pay for them "
b,yes 
sd," i guess i, i want to see if there's anything i really want to see there, so i don't end up watching the, um, prime time on some of the standard channels as much, i tend to go to my premium channels first,"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"well we have cable,"
sd,"but we only have cinemax,"
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
sd,and we start out with evening shade 
b,uh-huh
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
sd,you know 
b,yeah
sd,"i'm not always sitting down,"
%,"and, -"
sv,monday night's pretty good with murphy brown 
aa,yes
aa,"yes,"
aa,yes
sv,"i just, i love that, all those, that two hours "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, now tonight i just finished up with that a woman called jackie,"
qy,did you watch 
b,uh-huh
na,"we had watched it, uh, i guess sunday night and monday night,"
sd,but we didn't get to watch it tonight
b,"yeah,"
sv,"it, it was pretty good,"
sd,"it, uh, sometimes i like a dramatization,"
sd,"and i like, uh, u s a, when they had their, uh, uh, mystery movies and things, their "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, i like those"
sd,"we very seldom watch any, uh, public television, channel thirteen"
qy,do you watch it much?
sd,"the only night we tend to watch some of that is on sunday nights, starting fairly late, like i'm talking ten o'clock and maybe toward midnight"
sv,they have some british comedy 
b,yes
sd,and there's a variety
qy^d,"some of them is, uh, black adder or good neighbors or yes, prime minister and are you being served?"
sd,"they, they rotate those around,"
sd,"and, um, we like that british comedy"
sv,"british comedy is very fast,"
sv,you really have to 
aa,yes 
%, but -
sd,now we haven't watched any of those
sv,"they're real good,"
sv,"but they do come on kind of late,"
sd,but we really do enjoy those
sd,sometimes we get to watching some stuff on the discovery channel
b,"yes,"
sd,now we have watched some things on that
sd,and i'm amazed sometimes what i see on there
sd,but i'm very intrigued
sd,"i, one time i was watching an operation,"
sd,"and i thought, gee,"
b," yeah,"
%,"we had, uh, -"
h,"i don't know,"
sd,"my husband loves to, uh, that male syndrome of flicking that channel,"
sd,"so, you know, and he's sit in front of it"
sd,"and, and he went by"
sd,"and he said, whoops,"
sd,"and he backed up,"
sd,"and, you know, there's this surgery going on as we're eating our dinner "
b,yeah
sd,and i'm saying let's move right on 
b,"yeah,"
b,"right,"
b,"right,"
sd,but our grandchildren like that discovery channel 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd," and they just thoroughly, you know, enjoy that "
b,uh-huh
sd," in fact, i think they were watching something on, uh, whales, or killer sh-, sharks, one or the other "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, so we have watched that "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, otherwise, of course my husband's into the football "
b,oh
sd," and, you know, i will watch that some if i'm reading or doing something else, you know "
b,right
b,"yeah,"
sv,i'm not into watching sports
sd,"now my husband likes to watch football,"
sd,"he's not really into, uh, baseball or basketball too much,"
sd,"but, uh, football, soon as it's fall, then he likes "
b,yes
b," yes,"
sd,"and sometimes now we're getting that, uh, the other football where they play it inside,"
sv,"and you know, this is a, you know, this is too much ,"
sv,"saturdays and sunday, this is fine,"
qh,but do we have to carry this on into the summer and the spring 
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, but he will, uh, he'll flip around,"
sd,"i think the other night we had on, uh, uh, it was a, it was car races, some kind of car races where they were bumping over hills and flying into the air and coming down"
sd,i don't know what channel he found that on 
%,um
sd," and, uh, but he will turn that on, especially for, if, again, if our, uh, oldest grandson is over here"
sd,he's ten 
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, they'll find something like that and just absolutely sit glued to it, i, you know,"
sd,"i keep telling them it's the same mentality you know,"
sd,"and something's wrong,"
sd,"and, uh, but, uh, and we very seldom watch television on a friday night or saturday night, because we're not home "
b,oh
sd," and, uh, so, and sundays, uh, we usually have, all of our kids are over on sunday,"
sd,"so, you know, we don't get into that, except that sometimes we'll get into their home videos "
%,um
qy, do you ever watch that?
ny,"yeah,"
%,"the, -"
qy^d,you mean talking about the funny home videos and stuff 
ny,"yeah,"
ny,uh-huh 
ny," yeah,"
sv,those are pretty good 
^2, that are sometimes so dumb 
sv,"i mean, some of the, -"
sv,"but very true to life,"
sd,"i mean, i've seen our family in several of those situations "
sv,"uh, national health insurance, i think, is a problem inasmuch as the quality of health care that people would receive"
b,right
b,"yeah,"
sd,"because, uh, the articles that i've read regarding national health service in canada and england has indicated that, uh, -"
%,"what i-, -"
sd,"stay, stay in line for, uh, four hours to get an aspirin from a doctor"
b,right
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i'm, i'm sort of mixed on this"
sv,"i think that the, the answer may lie in, uh, not in so much a, uh, national kind of medical thing that li-, like england has but more of a, um, national insurance, uh, sort of clearinghouse or whatever"
sv,"i think that, uh, too many, uh, -"
sv,"the problem with, with right now is w-, that we've got too many different health insurances that people have to go through"
sd,"and, and i think that, i think you, you mentioned canada"
sd,"i think that they have a system where, uh, they, the government deals with the, with, -"
sd,"i mean, you, you go to whoever you want but file through one, one s-, particular,"
b,"um, i see"
sd,"and that way they, they are able to reduce prices because they've, you know, it's, it's all one, one centralized thing"
b,yeah
sv,"well, i, i think that, uh, again having gone through a period when i was out of work and had to buy health insurance on my own,"
x,<<very faint>> 
b,uh-huh
aa,right
sd,"uh, i, i was listening, uh, on the radio the other day"
sd,"and they were talking that, s-, s-, something like this, -"
sd,"i think they were talking about the fact that, um, the money that could be saved, um, in administrative costs and so forth nationwide by consolidating into sort of a national insurance provider, um, could, uh, could, -"
sv,"they could make it, i-, i-, provide health insurance to, to people who couldn't afford it just by the money they would save"
aa,yeah
sd," uh, we're currently, where i'm working now, under blue cross"
x,<<very faint>> 
sd,i don't know what the total cost of the program is
sd,"but for dependent coverage i'm paying a hundred and seventy dollars a, a month or something like that"
b,right
sd,"so i assume that probably the total cove-, cost is probably,"
sd,they're probably picking up about half of it
b,right
sv,"and that's a pretty good policy,"
sv,"but if you had something like one of these, uh,"
b,"yeah,"
^2,h m o
x,<<very faint>> 
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"and they're, they're fairly expensive"
sd,"i, i, um, i ha-, i was on an h m o, uh, up until last year "
b,<<very faint>> yeah
%,"and it was, -"
sd,i forget how much i paid a month
sd,"but it was much, you know, is at least twice if not more expensive than the regular health care"
b,<<very faint>> yeah
sd,"and, uh, the reason i, i quite was because of, uh, not because i didn't like it,"
sd,"i, i really kind of did"
sd,"uh, the reason i quite was just because the, the doctor a, a certain doctor that we en-, enjoyed going to was no longer associated with that h m o"
sd,"so we, my wife decided she wanted to, to stay with that doctor,"
b,yeah
sd,"so, we went to the, to the, the medical insurance that we have at, here at work,"
b,yeah
%,"and, uh, i, uh, i like the, i like the convenience of the h m o in, in a certain respect because it, uh, even though you're, -"
sv,once you find the doctor that you like it's not a problem
sv,"you know, a lot of people complain saying well, i don't want to, uh, have to be told who i need to go to"
sv,"but, you know, if you don't have a doctor anyway normally it doesn't really make much difference"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's right
sd,"and then, we did find several good doctors"
sd,"and, um, like you say it's, uh, five dollars an office visit"
sd,"and, um, my wife was in the hospital had our, had our daughter"
sd,and i think her total bill was around three hundred dollars 
ba,"oh, goodness"
bf,delivery room and everything
b,yeah
sd,"include-, including a private room because there was a little extra that she had to pay"
sd,"but that was, that was still included in that pr-, that cost"
%,so -
b,<<very faint>> yeah
sv," it's really nice because they, th-, you know, their, their attitude is different than, than a regular, uh, insurance, uh, health insurance, uh, the, in, in a, h m o, you know,"
sv,"they're trying to prevent a problem by, by keeping the cost down at the front end,"
b,<<very faint>> yeah
sd,"they, they charge five dollars"
sd,"a s-,"
b,yeah
sv,"you're more willing to go in and try,"
sv,"as to a company's benefit,"
x,<<very faint>> 
b,yeah
sv," because they don't have to worry about going in and, and paying,"
x,<<very faint>> 
b,right
%,"<<very faint>> that's a, -"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"i, i, uh, i, i really liked it"
sd,"we both, my wife and i both did"
sv,"you, you don't have to worry about filling out forms, uh, you know, for reimbursement and all or, you know, getting paid eight percent of, of whatever"
sv,"you just pay the, the five dollars right then"
sv,and then you're done with it
aa,yeah
sv,"but here again the, the doctor's practices in hospitals,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, you take a hospital, uh, the physical plant itself,"
sv,"you have to pay your share of the operating of that eight story building, uh, when the e-, rooms are empty"
b,right
sv,"so, they spread the costs out over, uh, all the patient costs"
sv,"and, uh, that's how you come up with aspirin that costs four dollars apiece and things like that"
b,right
%,"well, they, and you know, they're also p-, -"
%,"take-, -"
sv,they're taking up the cost of people who can't pay
b,right
sv,"you know, they, they get a lot of, uh, a lot of, uh, people who are j-, just have to be there and can't afford it"
sv,"and so they, they know they're not going to get pa-,"
b,<<very faint>> yeah
sv,"so they,"
b,<<very faint>> yeah
aa,yeah
sd,"my daughter and son-in-law had a baby,"
sd,"he-, he'll be three in august"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, their insurance plan that they're under encourages you to shorten your stay in the hospital"
b,right
sd,"and like she went in,"
sd,she had the baby
sd,and she was out in two days time
b,right
sd,"and it was treated almost like it was an outpatient visit to the hospital,"
b,right
sd,"the, the deductibles didn't apply"
b,right
sv,"and so that's one way, one way the insurance companies are trying to hold costs down is by, uh, -"
^q,"okay,"
^q,"if you'll shorten your stay then we will, uh, waive the deductible"
aa, right
sd,"our, our insurance is, uh, is doing something similar where they're also going to mor-, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc"," <<tv or radio>> okay,"
qw,what kind of crafts and hobbies do you have?
h,"oh, not very many of those at, uh, -"
sd,"sometimes i, i play the trumpet,"
sd,and sometimes i work on trumpet mouthpieces
b,uh-huh
sd,and then i have a five year old daughter
sd,"and we cut out things, kind of, you know, and color and, uh, and, uh, use markers and things like that"
b,uh-huh
qo,"um, how about you?"
%,"in, -"
sd,"well i used to be more into crafts, when i was younger, like high school stuff"
sd,i was in four h
sd,and i did a lot of latch hook 
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, and, uh, i've learned how to crochet,"
h,"but i don't really know, -"
sd,"i mean, i don't do it that much"
sd,not really an indoor hobby type person unless the weather's really bad
%, um 
sd, i'd rather be outside
b,"yeah,"
aa,exactly
sd,"um, i used to play trombone "
b,uh-huh
sd,"i don't know if that was a, -"
%,"not really, -"
sd,"i don't play it that much any more,"
%,"but i, um, -"
t1,what else do i do
sd,mainly do reading
sd,i don't have a lot of crafty type things i do
b,uh-huh
qw,"but, uh, < > what are some other things you enjoy?"
h,i don't know
sd,"my, my father is in the, in the antique business"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and he, uh, he goes around to garage sales"
sd,"and he buys all kinds of, um, china and figurines and statues and stuff "
b, uh-huh 
sd,"and, um, there's some stuff that's really for, uh, auto repair"
sd,it's called j b weld 
b,uh-huh
sd," and i repaired a, a gasoline tank with it once"
sd,"but he,"
sd,it's an epoxy resin that you mix together
ba,"oh, cool"
sd,"and he makes like, -"
sd,"the other day he was working on a hand that was shattered on a, a statue that's real small,"
%,it's like about maybe -
sd,the hand's about the size of a cricket
ba,"oh, wow"
sd,"and he was repairing that,"
sd,"and, uh, it came out pretty good"
sd,"it's kind of a, kind of a ivory color all over and "
b, uh-huh 
sd,"and it looked, you know, just like it, it had been there all the time"
%,huh 
sd,"and he fixed some, fixes some bowls that have the cracks or chips in them, and, uh, molds that in"
sd,"he had a blue, blue bowl a few weeks ago that he, he fixed that way"
b, uh-huh
sd,"it worked out real well, too"
sd," and then, "
qy," do you ever, -"
br,huh?
b,yeah
sv,"course that's like that, that, uh, hooking that you were talking about"
b,yeah
sv,that takes a lot of time
sv,that's great that he has a lot of hobbies and stuff
b,yeah
sd,"and he used to paint, um, a long time ago,"
sd,but i think he's stopped pretty much now
b,oh 
sd,"but outside of, outside of art class in, in school, i, i stopped doing most of that, unless i, i mean, like he has a computer,"
sd,"and i use, um, the graphics "
b,yeah
b,right
ba,that sounds interesting
b,uh-huh
qy,"um, does, does he ever, uh, refinish furniture or anything like that?"
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,"sometimes,"
sd,"but it's not one of my favorite things, especially from the vapors,"
sd,"and we had, uh, an entertainment center we did last year"
sd,"uh, we bought it at an, unfinished, uh, furniture place "
b,uh-huh
qy,"pretty time consuming, isn't it?"
ny,"oh, yeah"
sv,"but, it's g-, it's nice to have it when you're done,"
sv," i mean, looks pretty "
b," uh-huh,"
aa,sure is 
sd,"so, i've done that once"
sd,but it didn't come out that well
qy,"did you use a, did you use a zar stain?"
no,"uh, i don't remember"
%,"it was, -"
sd,"i had my parents buy everything,"
sd,"and i ended up, -"
sd,"it was their table, their kitchen table"
sd,it came out really dark
%,"um, < > they had a, um, -"
sd,"well i saw the commercial on t v,"
%,"and they, -"
sd,"and, uh, and the people at the unfinished store recommended it,"
%,"that's called, -"
sd,"it's z,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, it spreads real evenly"
sd,"and it doesn't dry too fast,"
%,"so it's, -"
sd,if you get too much in one spot you can smooth it out
b,yeah
sd,"and uh, we,"
sd,kind of made it sticky for a while
sd,"but after it dried out, it was, you know, it was real hard,"
sd,and it was all right
sd,"i remember it took me a long time,"
sd,"it took me like several months, or several weeks to do it during the summer,"
sd,"and then after i got it done it was pretty dark, and ended up not being real smooth looking"
sd,since i've moved away they've had it redone
sd,"so, i kind of, kind of gave that hobby up real quick"
b,yeah
^h,"but, i don't know"
sd," like i said, i like doing a lot of outdoor stuff,"
sd,"so but during four h, i mean they really encouraged to do all kinds of crafty stuff, which is in-, interesting,"
sd,i like that 
b,uh-huh
qy," were you in a, were you the girl scouts, too"
%,"or, -"
nn,"no,"
h,"well, yeah"
sd,"when i was real young i was for a couple,"

fc,bye-bye
qy^d,so you have a child 
ny,yeah
%,"we, -"
na,two year old daughter in child care
sd,and we went through the process of searching for child care and 
%,"uh, -"
qo,"how about you,"
qy,do you have any children?
ny,"yes,"
sd,our first
sd,and he just turned three months
ba,"oh, boy"
sd,"so, we're just starting into hunting for child care"
ba,yeah
sd,"right now, both of us are students"
bh,are you?
qw,where are 
%,"uh,"
sd,"uh, university of southern mississippi"
ba,no kidding
%,"uh, she's, -"
sd,i was a professor in a university here in california for a while
b,yeah
%,"yeah,"
qy,"uh, are you going to, uh, put your son in child care in a, a year or two?"
na,"uh, probably uh,"
sd,"actually spring semester a year from now he's going to have to be in child care f-, uh, five days a week more than likely"
b,yeah
sd,because my wife will be doing her internship that semester
b,uh-huh
sd,"it will be forty hour week, not, no, eight to five type of thing"
b,yeah
sd," so , depending on what my class schedule looks like, he may spend four, si-, anywhere from four to eight hours a day in child care at that point"
sd,"right now we're trying to avoid it,"
sd,"but we just, as a matter of fact just yesterday hired a, a girl to, uh, watch him"
sd,"uh, i get out of class at certain time"
sd,"and my wife is already supposed to be on her way to her class you know,"
sd,"once a day this overlap happens where we can't, one of us "
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"so for about twenty min-, twenty, thirty minutes a day we got a baby-sitter comes in"
ba,"well, that's a good experience, i think,"
sv,"and, uh, there are a lot of things to think about"
sv,"and the articles that are written on the topic,"
sv,"and they kind of boil down to, uh, -"
sv,any other important decision you really have to explore the alternative 
b,uh-huh < >
sv," and what we found, uh, to be the best guide was our own instincts about,"
b,yeah
sv," and, uh, that's more important than anything else"
sd,"we could have sent, uh, her to a fancier, uh, facility"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, she goes to a home"
sd,"this is a, uh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"they've been here probably thirty, forty years"
b,yeah
sd,they've got three daughters
sd,"uh, and,"
sd,"and, uh, they're both there"
sd,and they have a kid that comes in and helps them in the afternoon
b,uh-huh
sd,"and our daughter is healthy, happy, well adjusted and enjoys going "
b,yeah
sd,so 
ba,"uh, that makes a big difference"
%,"i th-, -"
sd,"if it's good, -"
sv,i think it's very good for the child
aa,yes
sv,"and if it's,"
sd,"and, and that's really what we've learned about it"
sd,she'll have to go on to something more stimulating in terms of preschool in a year 
b,yeah
sd," but, uh, we feel real fortunate"
sd,"and we were able to, uh, just, uh, choose in the marketplace"
qw^d,"i don't know what it's like around, uh, hattiesburg"
sd,"there's a lot of child care available, but "
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,and we were a little slow getting on the waiting list 
b,yeah
ba,i'll bet they're involved
b,yeah
sd," uh, they, uh, they have a subbranch, uh, american family counseling"
sd,"and their people staff this, this, uh, the child care center just off campus"
sd,"but, uh, they have a pretty good size waiting list"
b,yeah 
%,"so, -"
%,"well, that's, uh, -"
sv,"i know it's, it's a real hard thing to do, even for people in, in, uh, university communities"
b,uh-huh
sd,"out here at manford, they have a, you know, a, a, a real good facility"
sd,"and there, uh, is quite a waiting list to get into that"
b,yeah
sv,"so it's, uh, uh, you know, it's a, it's a, it's an important,"
sv,it's an industry that's still a cottage industry 
b,yeah
sv," and i think this is b-, really "
sv,"a cottage industry's the best way to do it really,"
%," because if you over, -"
sv,"i think that, uh, my own interest in, in development, human development "
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
b, yeah
sv,"because, i think what we're going to go to is much more commercial entrepreneurial learning ventures in the market"
sv,"as a matter of fact, my future is banked on that, uh, professionally because i believe that, that there are, uh, pressing needs in the marketplace, unmet by schools, colleges "
b,uh-huh
sv,primary skills which turn out 
aa,yes
sv,"and it's amazing how much good things like, uh, sesame street will do"
sv,"it's, it's phenomenal"
sv,"it's phenomenal, the programming, the human operating system,"
sd," well, th-, the question was talking about the juries"
sd,"and, uh, one of the things i thought about was a lot of the drunk cases that they were having, that, especially for repeat offenders that, uh, -"
sv,maybe there should be stiffer penalties for those people who come back again and again
sv,"uh, so that, uh, a judge, i think, would be the most appropriate person to, uh, to be able to sentence somebody since they do it over and over again every day"
aa,right
sv,"i, i kind of agree with that,"
sv,"uh, i, i think that in some cases that's considered to prejudice the current case "
aa,right <<very faint>>
sv," so a judge, you're right, should have the whole dossier of the criminal "
b, uh-huh
sv,"and if they're judged guilty would probably be in a better pri-, position to give an appropriate, uh, sentencing"
aa,yeah
aa,see i agree with you
sd,"uh, one thing i heard was this, where they have, instead of going to the regular court, they have a, a mock court"
sd,"i mean, it's supposed to be all legal and everything"
sd,"uh, you go"
sd,"and you present your case,"
sd,the other side presents their case
sd,and you're done with it
sd,it's almost like the night court we see on t v
b,uh-huh
%,"uh, and, uh, but it's not that we have, uh, such, -"
sd,"it didn't backlog or all of the, uh, the cases that are, uh, all ready pending"
%,"uh, so i, -"
sv,that was one thing i thought about that would be really neat if we could do it that way
%,"in other words, not,"
qy,there would be some types of crimes for which you're not guaranteed a jury trial?
ny,yes
%," now, -"
arp_nd," i, i, i don't, -"
ar,"th-, there's a point on which we don't agree"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i would tend, myself, to say that we should continue to guarantee a jury trial for criminal cases anytime a, anytime a, one of the parties wants one"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and i, usually it is the defendant, i guess, that wants to have the jury hear the case"
b,sure
sv,"so i'm not out for streamlining things to the point where we, uh,"
sv,"that would require a change in the bill of rights, i believe "
%,"and so, -"
sd,"and, and i wasn't, i didn't mean that "
bk," oh, oh, okay "
sd,"i, i didn't mean that, no"
sv,"because, i mean, gee whiz, if i was, uh, uh, didn't have that right, you know, not to have a jury that, oh -"
sv,"yes, i would feel, uh, you're right, that my civil rights had been violated"
sv,"but i meant for some, when both parties agreed that yes, we're going to have a judge here"
sv,"we're not going to have a jury, you know,"
sv,let's get it over with
sv,"sort of like car accidents, you know, -"
aa, right 
sv,well i think that's all ready possible
b,yeah
sv,"i think,"
%,yeah 
aa,right 
aa, so i agree that that should be encouraged
b,uh-huh
sv,people should know that that's an option just in case they feel they have to have a jury trial
sv,"but i think most lawyers do a pretty good job of making that evident to, to clients unless they feel they can, you know, tweak a jury into "
aa, right
^2,giving a different sentence 
b,uh-huh
sv, the take 
aa,right
aa,yeah
%,"and i suspect it, in cases like, -"
sd,"i guess we were supposed to be doing criminals though, rather than civil"
qy,is that right?
no,"well, i, i, i-, we're at liberty to, to talk and, and meander as long as it's all on the same theme"
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sv,"well, uh, in the case of,"
sv,"and i think that may be where jury use is overdone,"
sv,"i mean there are cases where they could be settled,"
aa, right 
%,"but the lawyers are really, uh, -"
sv,"it's to their advantage to play to as big an audience ,"
sd," so uh, i was wondering too, if they were thinking of about the judge making awards in civil cases "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, i'm not so sure i'm in favor of that"
sv,but i am in favor of it for criminal cases 
sd,so there's a difference of my view there for those two 
aa, right
aa,right
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"bu-, well you can tell i haven't been in too many juries , judges chambers or anything like that "
qy, have you ever had to serve jury duty?
nn,"n-, -"
no,well i was called once when i was nineteen 
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, but i was doing so many other things that they took pity on me"
sd,"and, i was doing school and things like -"
sd,"they, they let me out"
b,uh-huh
sd,"an-, i've never had to it since"
sd,and that was almost twenty years ago 
b, uh-huh 
%,"it isn't, -"
sd,"sort of amazed me they first caught up with me for the first time,"
sd,"that would have been about, uh, twenty years too -"
sd," uh, uh, just last year -"
sd,"and, uh, the case i heard was a criminal case"
sd,"and it seemed it really,"
sd,it involved two bicycles
sd,we didn't do the sentencing
sd,the judge did
b,huh
%,so -
ba,how interesting
sd," we, we a-, rendered a verdict"
sd,and then the judge was the one to do the sentencing
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh 
sd, and that was here in wisconsin
sd,"so i, i don't know if that varies from state to state or if it, -"
fp,hello
fp,"hello,"
fp,this is jim in dallas
fp,"uh, how you doing?"
fp,fine
fp,i'm callie in garland
qy^d,"oh, you're right here,"
%,okay 
ny,yes
b," yeah,"
sd,"i'm actually working tonight,"
sd,"i just, uh, called and came in"
b,oh are you
qy,do you work at t i?
ny,"yeah,"
qy,you?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i just got a little booklet, uh, this not what we're supposed to talk about, just got a little booklet in the mail with the gifts,"
sd,"and i thought, i better make some calls"
aa,"i know,"
aa,"i know,"
%, they
b, yeah
sd,"well, i haven't had a chance, i haven't got a chance to look at them yet"
sd,it was a lot nicer than i expected
sd,"my daughter, uh, got a few calls at home"
sd,"she talked to some student in, -"
sd,"i guess they give them to computer students, too, in, uh, virginia, something like that"
sd,she's talked to two students
sd,"i've talked to, -"
sd,"i don't think they were students,"
sd,"one, i think, worked at a university, university "
b,yeah
b,"oh, yeah,"
ba,great
ad,"uh, we're supposed to talk about the elderly now, i guess, uh,"
aa,"yes,"
aa,we are
qy,"do you have anybody that you, uh, are close to that decision on, or anything,"
sd,"or, i've thought about it for myself and all,"
sd,"and my wi-, my wife's mother is in a retirement home"
sd,she's not in a nursing home uh
%,"oh, well that's a, -"
qy,did you push the button?
ny,"yeah,"
qy,"did i, didn't we push?"
qy^d,"did we,"
sd,"let me, i'll hit it again just in case"
b,"okay,"
sd,just in case 
sd,"i did it as she said,"
%,yes
sd,"but, uh, she's "
%,"now, what, -"
b,oh
sd," and it's, it's a, uh, it's a brand new one"
sd,"it's a catholic, uh, retirement home for nuns"
sd,"it's at, uh "
b,oh
ar,"no,"
^h,"let me see, trinity,"
sd,"i keep calling it trini-, -"
ar,"it's not trinity,"
%,"i'll think of, -"
sd,"incarnate word,"
sd,and they have a retirement home for the nuns 
ba,"well, isn't that neat"
sd, and they take some lay people
ba,isn't that neat
aa,"yeah,"
sd,and that one's really super
sd,"now i, i know what they're talking about on regular retirement"
%,"yeah,"
%,"there's not too many, -"
sd,"they do have a wing where the people who are really sick, you know "
b,uh-huh
ba,"oh, that's good"
sd,"and then they have other wings that we visited, uh, that are very nice"
sd,i mean it's just super
ba,that's neat
qy^d,"just supervised more or less than anything and security, i guess"
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,"they, they, they have, uh, like, uh, a guard with locks"
sd,we've been there once at night at christmas
sd,she just went in last year
bk,oh
sd,"she drives and everything,"
sd,"she, she, she's perfectly healthy"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh,"
qw,"what made you all decide to put her, or what made her decide to go?"
sd,"well, her husband died"
sd,"they were in the military together,"
sd,and she just did not want to take care of the house 
b,right
x," ,"
sd," and she visited the place, and then fell in love with it, and decided to just shun all responsibilities of any kind,"
sd,and so 
ba,"well, that's good"
sd,"and they serve meals, of course"
ba,that's great
sd,"they have clubs and a swimming pool,"
ba,so that's nice
sd,"now i, i know the ones where you're really ill, we visited a long time ago when "
b,uh-huh
sd,and they were all more or less hospitalized type 
b,right
%,"shut-ins and, -"
sv,it's a tough question
aa,"yeah,"
aa,it really is
sd,i worked in one as a teenager
sd,"i volunteered,"
sd,"oh, you got more experience than i do then on it"
sd,"well, it was really, it was really sad, heartbreaking, i guess"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,yeah
sd,"and, uh, i just, oh, i just felt for those people, especially the ones that never got visited"
sv," oh, that would be awful "
sd, that just bothered me 
sd,"i never thought about that, you know"
sd,"that just bothered me so much, especially, you know, at my age,"
sd,i was probably about fourteen
b,uh-huh
sd,and that really made a bad impression on me 
sd,"i always thought, not really bad of them, i mean, because they are, most of them i believe are probably pretty good for the people,"
h,"but, i don't know"
sv,"it's just a, it would be a tough, tough decision"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"i think that, uh, hopefully we as a country are learning a little more about it,"
sv,and they're getting nicer
b,right
sd,"i've seen on t v where they take animals and young children,"
sd,in fact my daughter is one
sd,"my wife took my daughters one year when they were getting some points for school, took them to an elderly home,"
sv,and boy that really pumps them up
aa,"helps,"
aa,yeah
sv,that is very nice to see young people
sv,"i think that's one of the sad things, is when you're in an older home"
aa,"uh-huh,"
aa,uh-huh
sv,"if you just have people your own age, you never get a chance to see kids or anything "
b,right
b,right
sv," you can't take care of them,"
sv,kind of obvious you can't take care of children or animals 
b,right
sv,but it's nice to have them visit and everything
aa,"yeah,"
sv,and get that youth back
b,yeah
sv,"you know, sometimes that even helps them, just being around young people to, because some of them are so, um, just stationary "
b,right
sv," i mean, they'll get in a wheelchair"
sv,or they'll just sit in a chair
sv,"and, and, until you come along and really try and pump them up, they're just stationary,"
sd,"and i feel like, gosh, that's all they do all day long"
sd,"so i do, love to see young kids go and, and men take the pets and everything"
sv,"i think that's a real, real neat idea"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"i think you do get more by stimul-, by stimulation"
sd,"my, in fact, my mother in law just visited"
sd,"she's just about seventy-five again, perfectly fine"
b,yeah
sd,"but, one, and, and she visited us here in, in dallas"
sd,"when she went back, every time she goes back to, uh, san antonio, my wife has two sisters there, too, she said she's much better,"
sd,"she's much more alive and, and, uh, active when she's been on a visit "
%,"that's, -"
b,yeah
sd," and, and our routine has obviously hectic with teenagers and everything "
b,right
%," and she's much, -"
sv,"and so the stimulation part is really important i think, like any animal, anything "
b,right
sv," you just lay around, uh, that's the fastest way to die, i think, you know"
aa,stagnant 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's exactly right
sv,i think they're really neat
sd,"um, of course i've seen those reports on t v, the horrible ones "
b,"oh, yeah"
sd, and that scares me
sd,i'm afraid i'm a t v flipper
sd,"anything bad, i like, i like to,"
sv,"but it's sad,"
sv,"it's sad,"
%,yeah
sv,"it's sad to think that we would do that to people,"
sd,"and you know, i've seen them on t v with, uh, bed sores,"
sd,and 
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,"and i just think, how can you do that?"
sv,"these people have given so much of their lives, you know, to, to america "
b,yeah
sv,and here is how we treat them
sv,just put them in a home and leave them
aa,right
sd,"when i was, uh, younger, we, i lived in the east,"
sd,"i'm from the east really,"
sd,"and it seemed like there were several people that i knew that had their, uh, parents, i guess they would be, but well in their seve-, -"
sd,living with them
b,uh-huh <<water sound>>
sd,"and one of them was even a woman who was fairly old,"
sd,"and i guess she, <<water sound>> she had her own separate room"
sd,"and i think, whether it's more a custom up there, or maybe because i was younger -"
b,right
sv," and it's just not a custom anymore to have, uh, you know, the grandparents live with you anymore"
sv,"i guess that, uh "
%,"i think, -"
aa,right
sv,i think it's neat
sv,"i think, uh, you learn a lot from them "
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,"and, and that's one of my favorite things to do is sit around and listen to their stories"
b,"oh, right,"
b,right
sv,"i think that's neat,"
sv,"because they really have a lot of good i-, insights "
b,yeah
sd,"he, he had him late in life,"
sd,"and he's, he'll be eighty this year"
b,oh
sd,"and i just, uh, he lives with different, you know, people in the family"
sd,he'll switch from time to time
%,"i just, -"
ba,"well, that's nice in a lot of ways"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"i just couldn't imagine locking, -"
sd,"not locking him up, but putting him in a home and just, -"
qy^d,bet you were surprised that you said that by mistake
%,"yeah,"
%,"right,"
sd,lock him up
sd,"that's what i think about it for me,"
sd,"i think, well, my kids better not do that to me"
aa,"i know,"
aa,i know
sd,"i don't want that, you know"
sd,"so i, i think of it, well, how would i want to be treated "
aa,"right,"
aa,exactly
sv,"it's easy to say, oh, yeah,"
^q,"let's put these old folks in a home,"
sd,"but when i think i don't want to do that, you know -"
sd,i don't want to be -
aa,that's right
sd, i'd want to have my little home
sd,"i always threaten my daughters,"
sd,"i say, well, i'm going to build a little house behind yours,"
sd,"and i'll take care of your lawn, he says,"
^q,but i'm not going to one of those places
^q,"oh, you're going to put me away"
aa,"right,"
aa,yeah
sd,"that's what my mother, -"
%,"she always, -"
^q,"you're going to lock me up one day, aren't you"
^q,"i can tell,"
^q,you're going to lock me up
sv,"that's what we, that's the way we call it, which is really wrong"
aa,i know
sd,"but my wife's mother, and the one, she's in san ant-, -"
sd,it's everything but
sd,the opposite of what you've seen
sd,i mean 
b,right
ba,that's great
sd,"again, a swimming pool, and grounds,"
sd,and she has enough room
sd,"she has two bedrooms, and a, and a "
ba,gosh
sd,they don't have kitchens or anything 
b,right
sd," but they have little, it's like uh, on each floor they have a little kitchen area "
b,yes
^2,"prepare your, -"
ba,"well, that's great"
qy,"now can she leave, um, on a day by herself?"
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,"it's, it's, it's nothing like that"
sd,it's like living in the hotel
sd,i mean 
ba,"oh, man"
ba,that's neat
sd,"uh, and she still drives, which we do, does scare us some, because she has dented a few things, you know,"
sd,"and we keep thinking about that, you know "
b,right
sv," because she, they get less alert,"
sv,"and they don't care,"
sd,"and i've seen some of these elderly people on t v you know, the ones from florida that just run into people"
sd,and they don't even 
b,right
aa,"i know,"
ba,"bless their hearts,"
sv,"you hate to hurt them by doing that,"
sv,that's 
aa,i know
sv,and you take away that driving ability
sv,and that would really be hard
sd,"we've,"
aa,"i, i know"
ad,"go ahead,"
fa,i'm sorry
qy,"oh, he still drives?"
ny,yeah
ba,"that's gre-, well, it's wonderful in one respect,"
qy^d,"but i don't know if you can afford the insurance,"
%,yeah
arp_nd,"well, luckily he drives a big old tank "
b,yeah
sv,"so, he, i mean, i don't think he, he could get hurt"
sd,i just hope to god he doesn't ever hurt anyone
sd,but he 
b,right
ba,that's good
sv,"i mean, people are all different"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,yeah
sv,"i, i wonder if they should give them a test, or at least maybe not take their licen-, maybe give them a refresher driving course, and just to see how well they are every five years"
sd,i saw that on twenty twenty
qy,are they doing it?
no,"they, um, you know, they're testing that, they're, you know, thinking of doing that"
sv,"and i think that would be a great idea, because i think they do, come, become less aware,"
sv,"and they just, i don't know, they, and they don't hear as well, for one thing "
b,yeah
sv, and that doesn't help
sv,"well, everybody needs retraining"
sv,"it doesn't hurt, uh,"
sv,"the best football players and all the opera singers still have coaches,"
sv,and i don't know why you couldn't after sixty-five every five years have a refresher course and then take another driving
b,right
sv,"it would sure, the insurance companies would, would probably help pay for some of that, you know"
sv,at least that way the burden is not on the family of taking their license or their car away 
aa,"right,"
ba,"there you go,"
ba,there's a good point 
sv,it's on the state 
ba, very good point
ba,very good point
sv,"but i think they maybe, should do that,"
%,"and then the families, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",all righty 
sd,"uh, i'll just hand it off to you"
sd,and hobbies in our spare time is what we've been selected to discuss today
sd,"well, uh, the hobbies that i pursue in my spare time, are crafts"
sd,"and, uh, i've been involved in making, uh, hat stands and, uh, rag dolls and, uh, different type hats with, uh, flowers and roses, you know, and, uh, that kind of thing, straw hats and,"
b,oh <<sounds like typing noises in background>>
sd,"and i enjoy it,"
sv,it's relaxing
sv,and you kind of get absorbed in it
sv,"so the time goes by, you know, before you realize anything is going on"
sd,"and i play the organ sometimes, uh, just for my own satisfaction not for anybody else's ears"
sd,"because i'm not that good at it,"
sd,but i like to bang on the keyboards once in a while

aa,it really is
sv,"especially if your spouse will get in there with you and get dirty,"
%,yeah
aa,"yeah,"
aa,exactly
sd,"i like things that, you know, two people can do,"
sd,"but i like the quiet of doing things away, you know,"
sv,"kind of gives you some space for yourself,"
sd,"and that's what i find in making the dolls and things, that it gives me something that i can create,"
sd,and i like to crochet and knit
sd,i made some afghans and that kind of stuff

b,"yeah,"
sv,"you too,"
sv,you too
ba,"well, great,"
^h,"well look, uh,"
sv,"i know it's probably late for you,"

fc,me too
fc, have a good weekend
fc,okay
fc,bye-bye
fc,"bye, now"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sd, i missed a part of it
qy,"we're to talk about what, lawns and gardens?"
sd,lawn and garden work and what you enjoy and what kind of work you do
sd,"i'm, i'm a putterer"
sd,i chose that topic because i really like gardening 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
%,"i, well, -"
sd,"it's, it's, it's very str-, strange that i got this call because my wife just called me"
sd,i was just in the shower after finishing mowing the lawn 
b, oh
sd,"this type of thing is working right in to start planting fall, fall bulbs"
b,uh-huh
%,uh
sd,we've had a late fall
sd,"it seems like, the weather, -"
sd,"in fact today it's really warm,"
sd,"and so many of the summer flowers are still pretty enough that you hate to pull them up,"
sv,but you know you need to pretty soon
sd,"well, that's the way this was"
sd,"the, the petunias were really great"
sd,"our mums are, are beautiful,"
b,oh
sd,"uh, i don't know if we, i don't think we've had a frost up here"
sd,"i've been, i was down in for a week,"
sd,so i don't know what happened last week 
b,uh-huh
sd," uh, but, uh, it seems like it's, i don't know if it's late"
sd,i'm sort of waiting for indian summer
sd,so i can get a lot of stuff down out here
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, i, i enjoy it"
sd,"we came here, we just moved into this, well, we moved in in november and put all, all the landscaping in this, this year"
sd,"we came from nine years in a condo, uh,"
sd,"and working in that condo, you didn't have to do anything "
b,uh-huh
%,so 
bf,so now 
aa,right
%,"you know, i can't, -"
sd,"this is my third, third house i think, i've owned, um,"
sd,"but, uh, it's interesting, you know,"
sd,"the only problem is that i do quite a bit of traveling,"
sd,and it sort of gets away from me 
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, but, uh, i, i enjoy most of it,"
sd,"and about this time of year there is, it starts getting a little old,"
sd,"and i start looking forward to, you know, having other things to do with my "
bf,the grass 
ar,"well, it is, it is for me"
sd,because i've been doing a lot of fertilizing
sd,"we had a terrible summer,"
sd,we had a drought 
b,oh
sd," and, uh, took a lot of watering and a lot of fertilizing,"
sd,and now it's really growing
sd,"and i'm trying to establish a good root, root growth "
%,um 
sd, ours seems to have slowed down here
sd,we're not having to mow every week religiously 
b,really
sd," but we're still fighting bugs, and ready to change some of the, the summer flowers out "
%,uh
sd," i still have caladiums that are pretty, which is a surprise this late in the year"
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,uh-huh
%,um
sd,"but like today, it's eighty-five degrees "
b,"oh, yeah "
sd," it's really strange,"
b," yeah,"
sd,"i hear that from, my brother-in-law lives in plano,"
sd,but that'll change 
b,yeah 
sd,"well, he always -"
sd,we'll wish we'd planted bulbs and pansies already
sd, he waits until it gets about seventeen below up here
sd,"and then he calls us,"
ba,"oh, my gosh"
b,yeah
sd,it's seventy degrees here in the sunshine
%,so -
sd,"well, texas has gotten to where it's a real problem as far as plants, because our summers are so terribly hot "
sd, and we have ice storms every year
sd,and there just aren't that many plants and shrubs that can take both of those 
b,uh-huh
sd,some of the things that used to be hardy are getting to where they don't make it through the two swings
b,"yeah,"
%,"that is, -"
sd,"i was, you know, i was like conditioned to it "
b,uh-huh
sd," they, they have to be hardened to it"
sd,"that's, that's strange with me"
sd,"you know, you think, dallas, you know, almost semitropical, you wouldn't have that kind of, that kind of problem,"
%,"but, -"
sd,"well, for the most part we don't,"
sd,but we have usually just a pocket of really bad hot and really bad cold
sd,"well, the summers have gotten where they're a lot hotter "
b,uh-huh
sd," but the, the ice storms really are stressful on all the, the plants that we have around"
sd,we've noticed that crepe myrtles don't do as well as they used to 
b,"really,"
bh,oh do they
sd,that used to be the kind of things we could plant all the time 
b,uh-huh
sd," you, you "
sd,"i love, -"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i love the, uh, the landscaping,"
sd,"like i say, my brother-in-law i get to carrollton quite a bit"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i go there on business,"
sd,"and i really enjoy getting around and seeing the different areas with different gardens,"
sd,"and texas is, -"
sd,"d-, dallas is very nice"
sd,"i really enjoy it there the landscaping, the homes, the architecture, the whole thing "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and my wife and i, -"
sd,"except for the lack of trees, out where we are "
%, well -
sd,"and when we get to other parts of the country where the trees are so beautiful, we really miss it"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"that we have, you know -"
b,uh-huh
sd, ohio's a very pretty state
sd,"we moved, in seventy-six we moved to chicago,"
sd,"we lived there for five years,"
sd,"and i remember the first time i took my wife there on a house hunt,"
sd,"uh, we were coming in"
sd,and before the plane landed she looked out the window
sd,"and she said, she said, there's no trees down there"
^q," this is illinois,"
^q,you're not -
sd,"and, when we got out to the area where we decided we were going to live and buy a house, there were no trees "
%,um
b,uh-huh
sd," and now all of a sudden it was being developed,"
sd,"and the first thing i did was planted all kinds of trees,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
qy,do you have any children?
ny,"uh, yes,"
sd,i have a daughter
b,uh-huh
sd,"i don't any children ,"
sv,so i'm going to have difficulty with this topic
bk,"oh, okay"
qo,"but, uh, what kinds of things do you and your family do?"
sd,"um, well, we go out and fly kites"
sd,and we go fishing
sd,and we go to movies
sd,and we go out to the farm
sd,"and, and, uh, she likes to pick flowers and look at birds"
sv,um then your kind family is probably pretty rare now a days
sv,i don't see a lot of families fishing and doing things like that
ba,that's great
sd,"well, i'm divorced,"
sd,"but that's what, when she's with me that's what we do"
b,yeah
sd,and we color a lot
sd,and i read her stories
b,uh-huh
ba,that's great
b,yeah
sv,"i think a lot of families now, they probably don't spend enough time together"
b,yeah
sv,"you know, whether their parents are together or divorced they don't spend enough time together"
sv,"and, and i think that contributes to a lot of why society is going downhill right now is because the basic family unit is being destroyed"
sv,just simply because that time isn't spent just doing things like fishing
sv,"and, uh, because that i think that when you spend a lot of time with each other you communicate a lot"
sv,"and the communication helps you build on your, uh, helps just, just build your family"
b,uh-huh
sd,"< > and even, even when i was, when i was, uh, living with her with did stuff then too,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
ba,"that's pretty, to me that's pretty rare"
sd,i know
sd,i like that
sd,"whenever i do have children i, i'm going to try as hard as i can to s-, see that we spend a lot of time together, you know,"
sd,"maybe just even, if we just rent a movie and watch it together just to make sure that everybody's not going out and doing and their her own thing all the time"
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, that's good sometimes because you need to, you know, get away"
sv,"but, um, i don't think you, you should spend too much time outside at the detriment of, of losing your fam-, the family unit"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's right
sv,because then you never get to know them either
b,uh-huh
sd,they're all grown up
%,"and their, -"
b,yeah
b,yeah
%,"and as i understand it, -"
h,"i don't know,"
sd,"i haven't experienced it,"
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sv,"and once they hit like ten or eleven or twelve, you know, you've pretty much lost them "
aa,"yeah,"
bf,they're out doing stuff by that time
aa,yeah
qy,"so, um, do you think that you, do you think that your family is pretty rare in that you do a lot of things or just the relationship between you and your daughter?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i really do because, because i don't see many others "
sd,"and when, whenever we go to the park or something sometimes on the weekdays, we'll see other families"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, not usually on the weekends we don't see very many in comparison"
qo,"what do you think is the key to, to just bringing the american family back together?"
qo,what kinds of things do you think can?
sv,"well, i think they can turn off the t v for one thing"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sd,because she always likes to do things whenever the t v -s off
sd,"you know, she'll forget about the t v completely"
sd,and i know i'm guilty of it
sd,like i came in from work today
sd,first thing i did was turn the tv on
b,uh-huh
b,right
sd,and i like to watch 'em
sv,"but, i think that's that is a big problem the television"
sv,"and it's, it's too static, you know,"
sv,it's something that you can do
sv,"but there's no thinking involved, no motion, you know,"
sv,"and i think, think that's another reason why people are, uh, so health conscious now is because america's becoming really a couch potato society"
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, people aren't doing anything just sitting around, you know, no thinking involved"
sv,"and now, i think i think people are trying to get out of that"
%,at least -
%,"and that, um, there's a lot of um, -"
sv,it's becoming really health conscious
sv,and that people are you know starting to look out for cholesterol and things like that trying to get out and workout more often and jog and walk and different things like that
sv,"and that's probably good, you know,"
sv,"if you get your family involved in exercising and maybe playing tennis or something like that, that also helps"
sv,"that's also something, you know, family oriented that everyone can do"
b,yeah
%,um
b,yeah
sd,"but when was, uh, when she was here last summer we played tennis"
sd,but she hasn't brought her tennis racquet over lately
b,uh-huh
%,"when, -"
qw,"how, how old is she?"
sd,she's five
%,"um well, she has, -"
sd,"we, we just been hitting the ball on the ground"
bk,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"she can't hit it in the air yet,"
sd,and then we kick the ball
sd,we play like soccer
sv,you've still have a lot of time before she gets up in years 
ny,uh-huh
ba,that's good
ba,that's good
b,yeah
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",um okay
fc,well it was very nice talking to you
fc,nice talking to you
fc,okay
fc, okay
fc,bye-bye 
fc, bye-bye 
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
qw,ellen what kind of a car do you think you're going to buy? <<tv and background noise>>
sd,"well, as a matter of fact, i was thinking about that the other day,"
sd,"and, uh, i really don't know the answer, ,"
sd,"uh, i would sort of like to, uh, think about something in the way of, uh, uh, sort of a sporty car but not any, not, you know, a luxury type sporty one"
b,yeah
sd,"but, um, something that still has a lots of amenities and, you know, gadgets and things"
qy^d,"oh, you do want a lot of that stuff?"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"well, yeah"
sd,"i like, i like some of those things"
sd,they come in really handy <<clicking sounds in background>>
qw,"what kind of, uh, things are you going to consider,"
sd,"you know, what, uh, you said something about the, about the, -"
t1,"well, what do you call them,"
sd,"you said amenities,"
b^m,amenities
qw,"but what about, um, their reputation of the company or the price"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"well, of course, i guess, uh, price is always the big consideration,"
%,"but, -"
sd,"it is for me,"
sv,"other people,"
b,yeah
sd," well, that's, that's a big one in my book,"
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, um, i have preferences for, uh, for some, uh, makers over others, um,"
sd,"and i would sort of like to buy american,"
b,yeah
sd,"but, you know, i'm not so totally hung up on that, that <<clicking sounds>> i wouldn't buy something else,"
qo,how about you?
sd,"well, um, the last car we bought was american because of, because of that reason,"
sd,"but have not been entirely happy with, uh, several things about the car, -"
sd,it doesn't seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be
bh,"oh, really?"
sd,"because several things, minor things sort of, -"
sd,"but still they cost us money, um, that we didn't feel like we should have had to pay, on a car that, that was that new,"
b,uh-huh
sd,we bought the car new
%,"and after, -"
sd,"um, well, well, well under two years we had to replace the clutch"
b,oh
sd,"and, they just said, well, you know, clutches are disposable ,"
sd,"and i said, since when?"
b,yeah
sd,"brake pads are disposable ,"
b,yeah
sd,"we know that,"
sd,but i never thought a clutch was disposable
aa,"yeah,"
sd,i wouldn't have thought so either
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"so that was, that was kind of a shock "
b,oh
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i, i guess there's a lot to, to think about when you're trying to make that decision"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"you know, the less actually, the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars, -"
sd,"they're called luxury cars even though they're much more expensive like, like, uh, uh, a mercedes benz,"
sd,"they don't have the history of breaking down or things like that, that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable"
b,right
sv,"you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a mercedes,"
aa,no
%,"but then, -"
aa,"no,"
sd,"but on the other hand, i guess, too, uh, whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune"
bh,really?
h,oh i don't know
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i've, uh, worked with a couple of people who have owned, uh, various years, uh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, even though they do a lot of the work themself then just buying the parts and everything is, is pretty expensive"
sd,"but for them it's, it's sort of a hobby, too,"
b,yeah
qw,"what kind of, -"
qw,what brand of car are you thinking about buying
qw,or like what things are you looking at?
sd,"well, i haven't re-, really gotten that far with it, um,"
sd,"i've always sort of liked general motors,"
b,uh-huh
h,"but, uh, oh, i guess, i really don't know"
%,how come -
sd,"i've been kind of, um, -"
sd,"i guess the commercials are getting to me, the toyota commercials,"
b,yeah
sd,"and i know that a lot of people i've, i've known that have had toyotas have been just extremely happy with them, that hardly had any problems at all"
b,"yeah,"
%,"that, -"
%,"i think that's, -"
sv,"i think they have a really good, uh, quality"
aa,uh-huh
sd,"my, uh, daughter has owned two different ones,"
sd,"and, uh, you know, we've had some work done on them"
sd,"but it's not too bad,"
%,"and the reason, -"
sd,"one of the reasons we, um, bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years"
sd,and he lived way out in the country
sd,"so he put a lot of miles on it,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, you knew it had, had been through a whole lot,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and yet, you know, it, it held up pretty doggone good,"
sd,"so,"
b,yeah
sv,they seem to be really durable
b,yeah
h,"so, i don't know,"
sd,"i'm, i'm not ready to buy a new car yet,"
sd,"but i don't know, if, if the next time i'm going to try to, to stay with buying something american or if i'm going to go for a little more, what i would consider to be a long-term investment "
b,yeah
%,"well, -"
sv,"and i guess, you know, you always have to think about things like, your gas mileage and stuff like that, you know, -"
%,you -
sd,"oh, it's easy to get gas mileage in this car,"
b,yeah
x,<<background noise>>
sd,it gets excellent gas mileage
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"that's one of the big throwing cards for, some of the foreign ones <<noise like one music note>>"
b,uh-huh
ad,"< > well, we talked long enough "
aa,i think so
b,"okay,"
fc,"well, enjoyed it"
fc,"all righty,"
ft,thanks <<tv and background noise>>
fc, bye-bye 
fc, bye-bye 
sd,well i wondered if i was going to get to talk to a male or a female on this type 
qy, have you been talking to males?
%,"yeah,"
%,"yeah,"
sv,"this is, this is probably more interesting if it had been a male and a female "
sd, i was afraid we might get into an argument
aa,right
sv,"well, uh, i guess uh, there have been certainly a lot of changes in the last couple of generations,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and uh, i guess the most significant probably is that so many are working now,"
b,right
sv,"they may be going to school, or may have elderly parents, or you know all sorts of other things"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"it, it seems too me like though that women's roles are changing faster than the men and therefore, the women are spreading themselves thinner,"
aa,"oh, i think so"
aa,absolutely
sv,"i, i, i think it's extremely difficult to keep up with all that we have to these days"
b,uh-huh
sd,"sometimes, i think i am going crazy trying to do it"
%,"but, -"
qy,do you work outside the home?
ny,yes
qy,do you have children?
ny,"uh, yes"
sd,"they are getting older now,"
b,uh-huh
sd,so they are not quite as much of a responsibility
sd,"but they are still there, you know,"
ba,oh sure
sd,"they still take time,"
sd,"and, and i, you know, i still provide most of the things that go on around the house"
b,right
%,"so, uh, yeah"
sd,"and for a while i was going to school too,"
sd,"and tha-, it was tough"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i uh, i think that while it's a good change for i think women to be able to fulfill their potential in whatever they feel, you know,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, i think sometimes other things suffer and tha-, -"
sv,i think it's hard to find a balance there
sv,but in some ways i think we are expected to do it all
sv,you're almost looked down upon if you don't try to do all of these things
sv,and 
b,right
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i have little children, four and one,"
sd,and i decided that it was very important to me to stay home
b,uh-huh
%,"uh, and when i, i, i happen to, you know be, -"
sd,"i'm very active with, uh, people, other people with children my age"
sv,"and most of us do tend to stay home,"
sd,"but when i run into people that, you know, just have recently had babies or have very young children and are working full time, i, there's almost a, uh, friction between us"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,"not people that are, you know, necessarily good friends,"
b,yeah
sv,it's almost as though it puts you on different sides of a fence
%,"you know w-, -"
sv,if you decide to go back to work then you feel like you are always having to defend yourself
b,right
sv,"and if you don't then, sometimes you feel like you're looked down upon by people that go back to work and so you're just wasting your time ,"
b,yeah
aa,"yeah,"
sd,it's a tough one
sd,"i mean, i've done some of both"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i, when my kids were real little, i was at home for a couple of different periods of time"
b,uh-huh
sd,"oh, i think the longest was less than a year,"
sd,"but still at least i was able to, to spend, you know, those first months with them"
b,right
sd,"but, uh, i mostly went back to work because i was tired of doing without things"
b,yeah
sd," you know, the money was the issue"
sd,"but, uh, even now, i would, i would like to not have to work in some ways"
b,right
sd,"it, it's kind of pull and tug,"
b,yeah
sd,"on the other hand, i can't imagine just being at home, uh, although i have a lot of interests and a lot of things i would like to pursue"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, still, uh, there's, there's sort of a feeling of accomplishment with having, you know, a job and all that goes with that"
aa,"no,"
aa,"that, that's definitely true"
sd,"in fact, i, i work out of my home"
sd,"um, i'm an accountant,"
b,oh
sd,and i do taxes and bookkeeping
%,"and i, uh, -"
%,"it was, -"
sd,it's a way for me to stay home
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i mean, i still, unfortunately have to be very disciplined in doing my work at five in the morning and ten o'clock at night,"
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, but it, it's worked out for, for my family,"
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
ba,that's a good deal
qo,"where do you think this is going in the future,"
qy,"i mean, do you think things are going to change,"
qy,or are we going to keep having to try to juggle all of this?
no,"well, i, i hope that they will change uh,"
%,"but, but i'm, -"
%,"i just, -"
sv,i know it's going to be a slow change
sv,"uh, i, i feel as though a lot of people are going back to just having a one wage earner"
sd,i mean i'm just thinking of my circle of people that i know
sd,"i know quite a few people who have decided to not have both, both, both, uh, couples, you know, both, uh, of the parents work"
b,yeah
%,"and yet, uh, i, i we-, -"
sd,"i hope to see employer based, you know, helping out"
b,uh-huh
qo,"what do you think,"
qy,"do you think we are,"
sd,"i don't, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i, well i see, i think some people wanting to stay home more and take care of the children"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, and even those who may not do it seem to be spending more time with their kids and really trying harder at making all of the, the family things work"
b,right
sv,"uh, but i don't know if they're going to ever give up their careers, you know"
sv,"it's sort of like they went to school and they worked so hard to get where they are,"
sv,i don't know if they want to completely give that up
aa,"right,"
sv,it's a very personal thing
sv,"but, it would be nice if there could be an in-between, a middle ground somewhere"
b,yeah
sd,"i think it's hard though when you talk about, about families and, and raising children"
sv,"because ch-, i think children have a hard time understanding a middle ground"
sv,"i think they, uh, they need security"
%,"and yet they, -"
h,"i don't know,"
%,"i, -"
sd,"from speaking from my children, the-, they aren't real flexible when it comes to things like that"
b,yeah
sv,"they, uh, they want to know things are going to be a certain way"
aa,"well, yeah,"
sv,"i think they, they like a routine of sorts"
b,"uh-huh,"
aa,right
h,"well, we will see"
sd,"i, i'm hoping to see more female leadership in our society"
aa,"well, yes,"
sd,"i, i like the fact that, you know, gradually you're beginning to see women in public office and executive positions,"
sv,but it's still a long way from being what it ought to be
aa,"oh, yes,"
sv,"the, the numbers are still very skewed to say the least"
b,yeah

qw,"what, what effects do you think it's had on our country?"
bf,"downside um, uh, well,"
sd,"the says we should, uh, go into the grief that, that's there"
sd,"and, you know, presidents have always avoided that "
b,uh-huh
sv,"so it's pretty serious, really, you know,"
sv,lot of things that aren't being addressed -
b,uh-huh
sv,"i think you know, that's pretty typical that, of the entire, entire involvement over that, you know, that nothing was really addressed,"
sv,"it was-, it wasn't, you know, it was never -"
sd,"we, we announced that we were going to war,"
sd,"it was such a gradual and subtle, you know "
b,yeah
^2,"gulf of tonkin, uh, resolution -"
qh,and was it a dolphin or a torpedo
qy, you remember that?
na,"i vaguely remember we, um, we had a, we had a, um, spy ship torpedoed or something"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,only only it was foggy
sd,"and finally president johnson said, well, they're weren't really sure whether it was a dolphin or a torpedo"
b,oh 
bh,isn't that something?
ny,"uh-huh um,"
qy,"so, um, do, do, do you think that like, uh, um, for example like in, in this past war, in the persian gulf war "
b,uh-huh
ad,hey mark 
b,yeah
aa,okay
fc,we'll see you
sd,i guess our five minutes are up according to me
qy,are they to you?
sd,"uh, i wasn't really keeping count"
sd,"but i guess,"
fc,good-bye
fc,"yeah,"
fc,"okay,"
fc,bye-bye
fc,bye
qw,where do you get most of your news?
sd,"i watch the macneil lehrer news hour,"
sd,and i subscribe to the paper on the weekends
qw,"where, where are you?"
sd,i'm in dallas
bk,"oh, yeah"
qy,are you in dallas also?
nn,"no,"
sd,i'm in san antonio
b,"oh, really,"
bk,okay
sd,i get my news from a combination of sources
sd,i take the paper every day 
b,uh-huh
sd," and i read it on the way in to work on the, in a carpool"
bh,"oh, really"
ny,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, and i watch the, uh, actually i watch the morning news before i leave for work"
sd,"and then, you know, usually over lunch, there'll be a big topic of conversation on something "
b,uh-huh
sd,"i normally find that uh, i-, i'm probably the most, um, news hungry of my friends,"
sd,"so i don't, we don't normally talk about the news at lunch"
sd,"i, i find that i have to only subscribe to the paper on the weekend, simply because i used to get it during the week "
b,uh-huh
sd," but, um, i would always end up arriving at work late, because i would always end up skimming the headlines, spending too much time,"
b,yeah
sd,"so i have to cut myself down to the weekend, plus after work"
sd,"um, the macneil lehrer news hour is on public television "
b,uh-huh
sd, and i enjoy that quite a bit
b,yeah
sd,"um, one of the women that i work with, her husband is iranian"
b,uh-huh
sd,so here lately with all the middle eastern news we've had some very interesting conversations over lunch
sd,"i will admit i work with, uh, someone who's iranian,"
sd,and he definitely has a very different slant on the news
b,uh-huh
sd,"he's very, very skeptical of the news media,"
sd,and i will admit i'm reasonably skeptical also
sd,"but he's, i don't know, uh, he's mu-, much, much more so"
sd,"it's sort of interesting though, because he does bring a, a much, um, different perspective with all the gulf goings on, um"
sd,"he was always speaking in terms of, you know, american imperialism reasserting itself"
sv,"um, i suppose it's a different attitude that we normally don't hear in the country"
b,uh-huh < >
sd,"well i, i, uh, i like the print news "
b,uh-huh
aa,"true, um,"
%,"the, -"
sv,i understand that the macneil lehrer probably doesn't
sd,"they, um, tend to spend quite a bit of time on one story"
b,uh-huh
sd,they will have maybe two or three main stories and just spend a very large amount of time
sd,"sort of like the, uh, what is that, a b c's nightline"
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, i guess they only normally stick with just the one, um, story"
sv,"but they, they can do a much better job since they don't have to chop it into little two minute stories"
bf,"they don't report on every murder and shooting that happened in, in every little town"
aa,"no,"
aa,no
sd,it's very much national interest news
b,yeah
sd,"a lot of times they end up, um, with these panels of experts"
sd,"and they go back and forth, where everyone's giving some opinions"
%,"and sometimes that, -"
sd,"i don't know the value of that, because i saw plenty of jokes and, and, um, oh, editorial cartoons about all the retired generals,"
sd,i've been getting a kick out of those lately
b,uh-huh
%,"although, um < > -"
sd,"i-, i'm only twenty-five,"
sd,so i've never actually been through a period of war 
b,uh-huh
sd, and i don't know anyone in the military
sd,"and i don't have a lot of background knowledge in, uh, military strategy and, and weaponry, and, and all that kind of stuff"
sv,and i thought the generals were very interesting
sd,"now when they started to speculate, i, i saw that for what is was,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but i thought the-, the-, they were interesting,"
sd,"and, and they shed some light on what was going on for me"
aa,i will admit it's interesting
sd,"i-, i-, i'm twenty-six"
sd,so i don't have any more experience in that than you
sv,"um, it, it, it was very interesting that it seemed like some of the commentators had their axe to grind, you know,"
sd,"there were some that were screaming for air power,"
sd,there were some that were saying the air power wasn't going to do it
b,uh-huh
sv,"and they seemed to mold the events to their view of the world, which i suppose just about everyone does,"
sd,"but these guys had a, a, uh, national soap box to stand on and, and express this view"
sd,"you know, one of the best television news shows that i saw during the war was a show on a saturday morning on a b c,"
sd,and it was for children 
b,uh-huh
sd," and it was hosted by peter jennings,"
sv,"and it was so interesting because they were relating the war to these children in their studio,"
sd,and they also had children calling in live from all over the country and asking questions
sd,"and they, they had all their correspondents in the different areas, in saudi arabia, and israel, and, and all"
sd,"they had them all, uh, on,"
sd,i don't know what you'd call it other than on line
sd,they had them all on hold 
b,uh-huh
sd," and if a child asked a question that the person in jerusalem could best answer, they would cut to that person,"
sd,and that person would answer the question
sv,"it was just very informative and interesting,"
sd,"and, uh, i was real impressed at how a b c handled, uh, translating,"
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i didn't see anything like that, although i did, uh, -"
sd,"i guess one thing that i found sort of interesting, -"
h,"this is getting a little off the topic,"
sd,"but there was a, a, a big push with the local t v stations to have little hot lines with counselors "
b,uh-huh
sv,i thought that was a really unusual thing
sd,"and our local h e b stores here, -"
sd,"i don't know if it's h e b statewide or whatever,"
sd,"but they have videos that, uh, -"
sd,"i don't know if they still have them,"
sd,"but they were free rental,"
b,uh-huh
%,"< > ju-, -"
%,"uh, it was, -"
qy^d," it-, with the children's aspect?"
na,right
sd,"it was something for children, that they, they had several advertisements on television pushing parents going and, uh, getting the video and watching it with their children and discussing it "
b,uh-huh
sv,i suppose that is a valuable service
sd,"again not having, uh, lived through another war, i don't know if that's a common thing that people thought of,"
sd,or if that was 
sd,well 
b,uh-huh
sd," uh, the, that type of technology just wasn't at people's disposal"
aa,that's true
aa,that's true
sv,so i don't think there's ever been a war that's been so thoroughly covered by the news
sv,"and <<blank spot in the tape>> probably more importantly, one that lasted short enough that, that people's interest didn't flag too badly"
aa,yeah
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","i tell you what,"
sd,"the first three days, i was glued to the television"
sd,i will admit the same thing
sd,"and i,"
%,"and i, -"
sd,"and they would run these extended two, three hour versions of the program "
b,yeah
sd," and i, i was just, i was horrified and fascinated by what i was seeing"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",i tell you what
sd,"the uh, the war start-, <<blank spot in tape>> -"
^h,"let's see, was it a wednesday or thursday?"
sd,"must have been thursday, uh,"
sd,"and friday night i was, i stayed up until two o'clock in the morning, sitting, right dead center in front of my television just watching practically with my mouth hanging open"
b,uh-huh
sd,"because i was watching c n n,"
sd,"and they would, they would switch back to one of their israel bureaus,"
sd,"and the people would be standing there in gas masks,"
sd,"and you'd be hearing the sirens,"
%,"and it was just, -"
sd,i was amazed
b,uh-huh
sd,"i, i didn't have that experience"
sd,"i, i don't have cable "
b,oh
sv," so i, i'm pretty much limited to p b s, which i thought, i thought they did a very good job"
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, i've got one question for you"
qy^d,i < > you say you take the newspaper
ny,uh-huh
sv,"um, i, i found the newspaper situation in dallas very interesting"
sv,"we've got the one fairly, well, relatively weaker paper, the times herald, and then the morning news, which has a very strong subscription"
b,uh-huh
qy,"does san antonio ha-, -"
qy,"you said san antonio, right?"
ny,uh-huh
qy,"do you have just one paper,"
qrr,or do you have several?
nn,no
sd,"there are two,"
sv,and they're pretty close
sd,"uh, the one that i picked is more similar in format to the newspaper,"
sd,i grew up near houston 
b,uh-huh
sd," and there are two major newspapers there that run pretty much neck and neck,"
sd,"and the one i picked here had the same format as the one that my parents took as i was growing up i mean, the same type of typeface on the headline and that kind of stuff"
b,uh-huh
sv,"it's piddly stuff to pick a newspaper over,"
sd,"and i enjoy, -"
sv,the comics are better in this newspaper
sd,this newspaper has the far side and the comics that i enjoy
sd,and the other one has some weird ones that i've never heard of
%,"so, -"
sd,"i, i actually take both newspapers on the weekends"
bh,do you?
sd,"i figure i'm only taking on the weekend,"
sd,and i can afford that
b,yeah
sd,"i, i find the news reporting in the morning news to be better,"
sd,"but i sort of have a liberal political slant,"
sv,"and the morning news just has an incredibly conservative editorial, um, outlook"
sd,"and my,"
sd,i get the times herald just to balance that out a little bit
sd,"he takes both san antonio papers, an austin paper, both houston papers,"
sd,"i guess he takes seven, the san marcos paper and the new braunsfel paper,"
sd,"but he's a football coach at southwest texas state university,"
sd,so he's getting all the sports sections
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, so, you know, he has these stacks of sunday newspapers that go unread "
sv,"in, in the light of what has been happening lately with the doctors that i know and lawyers and whatnot, i think national health insurance is a way to throw a lot of money at a very small problem"
^g,do you?
qw,why?
qw,why?
sv,"well, if you took half the money that they would spend in the state of texas for health insurance and gave it to qualified students to, so they could become doctors, the problem would go away"
qy,you think the problem is not enough doctors?
na,"i think the problem is that the doctor v-, doctors have conspired to limit the number of doctors, and that the lawyers have conspired to make sure that if you are a doctor, you are going to pay high premiums on your h-, uh, unemp-, i mean, on your liability"
ba,"gosh,"
bh,oh?
b,uh-huh
qy,and you think there are plenty of doctors?
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,i don't think there is a shortage of doctors
sd,"and i do know that o b, which is my field "
b,uh-huh
ba,it's astronomical
sv,now they can't doing anything about that
sv,i don't think they're in a conspiracy
sv,"i think it's our fault, because we as people just sue them"
ar,"no,"
sv,people don't sue 
sv,"people are very sue, sue conscious"
sv, lawyers sue
sv,if you put a ten thousand dollar cap on the amount of money that a lawyer could make from a law suit against a doctor 
b,yeah
aa,"well, that's probably true, too"
sv,but people are very conscious of how much money they can get real fast these days
ba,"well, sure"
%,"and, so, -"
sv,"but, you know, when you think about reasonableness, now, i believe that a law suit should have some foundation in the tort theory"
qy,you know what tort theory is?
nn,no
sd,"well, a tort is when you do something wrong"
b,right
%,"well, it, uh, -"
sv,an o b g y n doctor cannot control the fetus in the womb a hundred percent
aa,that's right
sv,"if the baby is born dead, well, that happens"
%,"well, -"
sv,"if, if they have complications and, -"
aap_am,it depends
sd,"well, i know, i mean, there are guys that are real slobs,"
sd,"but you know, there are also people out there that are really doing their job"
aa,"well, that's true,"
sv,they are 
sv,"many of them are unnecessary,"
sd,they are doing so many c sections 
sv,just to prevent a 
sd,because they have all these monitors now
sv,and if anything looks even a little bit funny 
b,yeah
sv,and 
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sd,"see, i believe "
sd,"so, it's terrible"
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, they have indigent health care"
sd,you show up at parkland bleeding 
^2,you'll get it
aa,that's true
sd,"in fact, you'll get it at presbyterian if you show up there, too"
b,yeah
sd,and we have that happen
sd,we have patients that go through parkland 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and at the last minute, they come to us"
sd,well 
b,uh-huh
x,< >
%,"so, -"
b,"yeah,"
sv,i think that if you just wrote the lawyers out of the equation 
b,yeah
aa, i'm for that
sd,"i've been through a two year divorce where the only one that came out ahead was my lawyer,"
sd,so 
b,yeah
sd,"well, i, i happen to know a few"
sd,and i even claim one as a friend
sd,he's a divorce attorney
%,"but, -"
sd,he better not be mine 
sv," i think he'll go nameless for the, for the purposes of this conversation"
sd,"but i also know an, uh, o b g y n who has stopped practicing"
b,"yeah,"
sv,some they do -
sd,"uh, he just said, -"
sd,they stop their o b at least
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i mean, he's not going to deliver any more babies "
b,"right,"
b,right
sd,his malpractice was five hundred thousand dollars a year
ba,that's incredible
sd,"and, you know, he said, i had to, he had to ear-, gross two million to take home as much as his malpractice"
b,yeah
sv,and most of them are very sincere
sv,most of them do the 
b,yeah
x,< >
sd,they are human
sd,occasionally 
sv,"well, you can be human and catholic"
aa,"i know you can be human and catholic,"
sv,"but, you're not likely to find somebody who is going to, you know, have a less conscientious effort"
b,"yeah,"
nn,no 
%,"i mean, -"
sv, most of them do
sd,i really believe that
sv,"from dealing with doctors, dealing with lawyers, there is no doubt in my mind who is more conscientious"
qw,"well, you know, who is getting rich?"
sv,insurance companies
aa,"yeah,"
aa,they are
sv,"you know, if you were able to write a malpractice insurance that would negate any financial obligation on the part of the doctor over and above the insurance, -"
sd,"say, say you have malpractice insurance and a kid dies or is malformed"
%,"or, -"
sd,"okay, we're being recorded"
aa,"all right, ron"
sd,"uh, number one, i am one hundred percent for total gun t-, control"
%,"i, -"
b^m,total gun control
aa,"yes,"
sd,i am not a member of the national rifle association
sd,"and,"
sd,"and, uh, i just have had my fill of what is going on with the crime rate"
sv,"and i really feel that we have to do something in order to, uh, to , -"
aa,"yes,"
sd,"i, i agree something should be done,"
sv,"but i, there, i don't believe there is any way of total control over weapons, because crooks and people who are going to perform things that are not correct will have access to weapons from somewhere"
sv,and that means they'll always have an advantage over us
sv,"and, uh, they may even get worse because they know we have nothing to support myself"
sd,"now, you know, i, i agree with a lot of the things you just said in your few moments because personally i used to be a great hunter"
sd,"and in the last few years i've said, no way"
sd,"matter of fact, if i find a, uh, a, a fly running around in the house, i pick him up and carry him outdoors "
sd,"i, i don't even hit him with a flyswatter,"
sd,"so i've, uh, gotten over this business of wanting to go out and shooting and, and killing and that sort of thing"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but i, i think that, uh, personally, that we do need some weapons available to most of the people"
sv,"most of the people really are, uh, honest and, uh, worthy of carrying on their lives properly"
sd,"uh, i'm sort of in line thinking in terms, -"
sv,i don't see anything wrong with this five day waiting period if the waiting period is utilized to really look at the background of the person purchasing the weapon
sv,i mean there's nothing wrong with that
qy,do you see anything wrong with that?
nn,"no,"
sd,"there's only one problem i have with the whole thing though, th-, is, you know, when they do it, i think our biggest problem is, yes, the, the crooks and what have you are going to get weapons if the weapons are available"
b,right
sv,i think the biggest problem we have in this country is there are just entirely too many weapons available and the types of the weapons
sd,i mean there is 
b,yeah
sd,"i'm again-, i'm against this, uh, automatic and semiautomatic stuff "
aa," right,"
sv,"there is, "
sv,i don't think we should have access to those
aa,no
b,huh < >
sd,"and, uh, maybe i'm a little bit strong when i said total gun t-, control"
sd,"that's, that's really not what i meant"
sv,"but, i mean we need control"
sv,we've got to be able to get a handle on what is happening
sv,"and we've got to reduce the number of weapons that are out in the, in the "
b,yes
sv,"and the, the people should be, uh, selected so that we know that they are all right and that they're, they're not, uh, acquiring weapons for illicit use"
sv,"uh, that is not good"
sv,there's nothing wrong with a person that enjoys the mechanisms
sd,"as a matter of fact, uh, there's a fellow out there working on my house right now who, uh, brought to me a target from a rifle that he, uh, pretty well, halfway designed"
sd,"and he, he put together the, uh, the bullets in it "
b,uh-huh
sd," and he was showing me that at a hundred yards, he kept five shots within a quarter of an inch of each other at one hundred yards"
sv,"now, see from a technical point of view, that is something that, that our military people need to know about"
%,um
sv,"so there are other interesting, uh, facets in, in guns and weapons"
sd,"this is a, uh, bolt action rifle, i think he has"
sd,"and he has done other things to the way the, uh, barrel sits in the, uh, the wood part of it"
sd,"and, uh, he designed the, the, the bullets themselves"
sd,and he has fantastic accuracy
b,uh-huh
sd,"just, just from a technical point of view, that interests me not to kill anybody with it or anything with it, but just the fact that a piece of mechanism like that could be made to be so accurate"
aa, yes
aa,"all right,"
sv,"you, you sound like you're into the technology of it, which is, -"
aa,"yeah, i agree"
sd,"and, you know, and, again, i'm, my entire family are, they are all hunters "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, you know, they, they don't appreciate my stand,"
sd,and i 
b,yeah
sd,i really don't
sv,"it's just when they come out and they say they need an uzi in order to do some accurate or decent deer hunting, i think , i think that's totally outrageous"
sv,"what's happening is people are losing, -"
sv,they seem to be losing their common sense over the issue
b,yeah
sv,"and the issue,"
sv,"uh, i, i think something will happen"
b,uh-huh
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
sd,i was trying to get my children quiet for a minute
b,okay
sv,"<<takes a deep breath>> well, credit cards, boy, that's an easy topic,"
aa,"ye-,"
qy,isn't it 
sv,it is 
sv,"it's one we all hold dear and near, i'm sure"
aa,"oh, yes,"
aa,yes
sd,i guess i've had some good experience and some bad experience with them
b,"yeah,"
sd,"most of mine's been pretty good, although i'm, i guess i'm like a lot of other people, now,"
sd,"i'm trying to, to pay off my credit cards"
sd,"and, and, uh, i've done pretty good at it"
%,yeah
b,uh-huh 
sd,"well, i do fairly good until i go in the store and i see something i want "
b,yeah
b,"uh-huh,"
sv,there is a big difference < >
sv,there's a big difference there
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,but most of mine that i use is strictly gasoline
b,"yeah,"
b,"oh yeah,"
sd,"i, i do that,"
sd,"i do that,"
sd,"but the rest, like i said, the rest of them i've been trying to, to pay off "
b,uh-huh
sd,"it's too easy to, to run into the gas station"
sd,"oh, it sure is "
%,"and, -"
b,uh-huh
sd,at least that's for me
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
b,yeah
%,so -
b,"but yeah,"
sd,"i've, i've talked to some who's really had some bad experience"
sd,"and kind of knock on wood i haven't yet, not bad"
b,"yeah,"
%,"well that's, -"
sd,"you know, i just, i'm just shocked at the end of the month,"
sd,"but ,"
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"well, i've been pretty lucky in that respect"
sd,"i don't charge, like i say, i've, i been trying to, to not charge except for emergencies"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, so, but i haven't really had any bad problems with credit cards"
%,"there's, you know, -"
sv,"they have, uh, wonderful features,"
sv,they're there when you need them
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sv,"and then they have bad drawbacks, too"
aa,yeah
sv,"it's, it's awfully easy "
sd,it's like paying twice
ba,"that's true,"
ba,"that's true,"
b,"yes,"
%,"so, -"
%,"i try to, -"
sd,"i did switch to one, uh, sponsored by the credit union, though that seems to be a pretty low interest"
b,"oh, uh-huh"
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"and you don't have an annual fee there,"
sd,and that helps
aa,"oh, yes"
sd,"uh, we used to have, you know, like several,"
sd,"but right now, we're just more or less at american express,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and that way we can go ahead and pay it off when it comes in
b,"yeah,"
sd,"that's one way to do it, because that, that forces you to pay for it "
b,yeah
^2,"pay fifteen,"
b,yeah
%,"and , -"
aa,"yes,"
sd,"i know,"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sv,and when you pay fifteen dollars a month it sure takes a long time
b^m,"takes a long time,"
ba,that's right
ba,it sure does
sv,"and now without the benefits of being able to deduct interest off, off your income tax "
b,uh-huh
sd,"of course it's been going down for a number of years,"
sd,but this is the last year you can take anything
%,so -
b,"uh-huh,"
b,yeah

qrr,"or do you, uh, have a lot of people come in and have to prepare for them?"
nn," um, no"

b,uh-huh
ba,my goodness 
qy,"well, what would you, uh, like to cook?"
qw,"what's, what, what's, what is your favorite, uh, recipes, uh, that you would like to have "
b,"um,"
qy,"now you're in dallas, is it?"
na,"right,"
sd,i'm in dallas
b,okay
sd,"of course, um, dinner parties down here probably, oh, turn out to be more things like barbecues "

sd,"i was, i was thinking in terms of mexican almost,"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,yes
b,"yeah,"
b^m,"uh, tex-mex, uh,"
sv,"mexican food, um "
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, that's a very interesting food though"

b,uh-huh
b,right
%,"we have, uh, -"
%,"i think som-, chico's -"
sd,"or, or in these different restaurants "
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, um, if i were to cook, uh, a dinner party, uh, it may be standard to you"
sd,"but, uh, actually i never get too much fried chicken"
b^m, fried chicken
b,uh-huh
sd,and i love twice cooked potatoes
ny," oh, yes,"
sd,i have
b,uh-huh
b,right
sd,"and, uh, i like broccoli casseroles "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"as you can see, i'm inclined towards the mexican type of a meal "
b,right 
sd,and i would probably have some quiet and gentle fried onion rings mixed in there with it too
b,uh-huh
qo,"so, uh, how would you improve upon that?"
b^m,"oh, improve upon that?"

sd,"i've, i've camped, uh, in the snow on a glacier"
sd,"i've camped, uh, basically almost anywhere, even to the point where we've had to backpack in and everything you carried in was what you had to use to sustain you for that, that camping trip and had to pack it back out"

aa,"well, we enjoy it, yeah"
sd,"but since i've been married and with a family, uh, we have to go where there's restrooms "

qw,what did you normally do?

sd,"um, personally, i, when i, when we were growing up and when we were going camping, i thought that was a little too structured of a camp ground"
b,yeah
sd,"um, you know, that was mainly for people in motor homes or, or had trailers or, and so on and so forth, where, you know, we really wanted to go camping in a tent "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, k o a is, is geared for the people that have a hookup "
bf," that actually travel, what, city to city, state to state"
aa,"right,"
aa,"exactly,"
sd,"and, uh, i started out basically camping when i was, when i was in boy scouts,"

aa,exactly
sd,"get out, -"
sd,getting out and enjoying nature and each other as company when we're out camping
%,"plus, you, um, -"
sv,"kind of makes you appreciate some, a lot of the things you take for granted"
aa,yeah
sd,running water 
b^m,running water 
sd, your hair dryer 
^2, and a private bathroom
sd, curling iron
aa,yes 
qo,what about your family
qy,do your kids and everything like to?
ny,"yes,"
sd,"they really do, they have a great time,"
sd,"and like i mentioned, uh, the, we, we've been camping a couple of times this year"
sd,and the last time was in october
sd,"and we went up to lake bonham,"
sd,and there was a playground for them
sd,"so they had swings,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",not very good 
sd, it's not been a good day 
sd," i went,"
h,i don't know
sd,i finished mine up about eleven and left it here with carolyn
sd,so i hope she's turned it in
qy, are you eating?
%,"uh, i ju-, -"
ad,"go ahead,"
sd,i'll stop eating
sd, i just barely got 
%," no it's, -"
br,say what?
sd,i just barely got home from the university
oo_co_cc," tell you what we can do is, uh, i can punch the, uh, one,"
oo_co_cc,"and then w-, after five minutes when the, uh, uh, voice comes on, we can talk all night if we want "
aa," okay,"
ad,"go ahead, "
ad,fire away 
sd," uh, i love the irony of, uh, talking about this subject on april the,"
sv,"but, uh, i'm afraid i'm, i'm probably in the minority"
sv,"i, i actually don't think that we, uh, pay too much in this country uh "
aa,i agree with you 
sv,"uh, i guess i do have a, a bone to pick with, uh, uh, the way taxes are distributed "
sd,"uh, i just finished fuming at the fact that we pay an eight and a half percent sales tax and no income tax when the income tax could have been deducted from the federal form "
%,huh
sd, and the sales tax can't
sv,i think that's regressive
sv,"and, uh, uh, it's kind of dumb"
sd,i hate the eight and a half percent sales tax
sd,"but, on the other hand, i don't mind that it's only on, you know, things that aren't like groceries and that,"
sd,it's not on that
sv,"well, i mean, nobody taxes groceries "
ar," oh, yeah,"
sd, they do
qw,where?
sd,in arizona
qy,is that right?
ny,uh-huh
sv,"but we have a pretty low income ta-, i mean pretty low tax rate here"
sv,"oh, i think the, the sales tax, they just got to do something about it"
b,right
sv,but that's the politicalness of trying to not create any new taxes
b,right 
sd,"but i guess when i hear, when i see the comparison between the united states and, uh, any other western country, uh, their, their rates are like, uh, forty-one, forty-two and ours are like thirty-six, thirty-seven, you know,"
sv,"if you compute as a percentage of total income, all taxes lumped together, we actually do pretty well"
sd,"t-, th-, there's no other country that's, that is taxed as low as we are"
sv,"well and i still think that, having lived in europe for awhile, you know, difference in living conditions "
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sd,"i'm, i'm not sure i understand what you mean"
sv,"well, i mean, i think, -"
sd,"i was in germany, you know, for several years "
b,right
sv," and i'd a lot rather pay taxes here and have what we have, then have to live there"
bf," oh, you mean, lowest end of living in spite of lower, higher taxes"
%,yeah 
sd, higher taxes
aa, yeah
sv,"i suppose that's true,"
aa,yeah
sv,"uh, probably m-, less so now than it was ten years ago or whatever"
%,"but, -"
sv,still's that way to some extent 
b, yeah
sv," i think the other problem is, you know, it, it's easy to complain about taxes because there's something you, theoretically, can do something about"
b,right
%,"but i look, for example, -"
sd,and you're not quite in the same situation
sv,but like school taxes for me 
b,right
sd,"i wish i didn't have to pay any more fo-, to my physicians in a year "
b,right
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd,"since, uh, i send my kids to parochial school, that -"
b," yeah,"
sv,"that, that's probably a little tougher on you "
aa,"it's not, it's not quite the bargain that "
sd," but, i mean, i pay them gladly"
sd,"that's a decision,"
sv,"i think it's a dumb decision on our part because countries like canada and england and germany do perfectly well with a, uh, two tract system in which religious schools coexist with secular schools f-, with the same tax money"
sv,"but, uh, i mean, that's, that's the way americans want to interpret it,"
sv,i guess that's all right 
%,"but, -"
%,yeah
%,"i, -"
%,"and if i were, uh, -"
sd,"when i was single and again when i'm retired,"
sd,that's always been a high priority 
ar," no,"
sv,i think that's just you though
%," i do,"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sv," i think in places, "
b,yeah
sv,"and, uh, , "
sv,"that seems a, a, like a cultural lapse"
sv,"i mean, people always used to be willing to ante up for the schools"
%,"they, -"
sv,"of course, i think with the graying of america, we're going to see that problem in lots of places"
aa,right
aa,yeah
sv,"people would rather, uh, increase the fire department and cut down the schools because it means more to them"
sv,but i think it's sad 
^2,or build roads
aa,yeah
%,"well, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
qw,"well, what's your opinion about capital punishment?"
sv,"well, cathy, i think that, uh, capital punishment certainly has a place in our society, um, maybe from the sense that there are some things that we just can't afford to have repeated, even in the remote chance of repetition"
aa,"right,"
sv,"i think i would agree with you on that, too"
sv,"i, i can't see any point in keeping someone who's obviously beyond any kind of rehabilitation, uh, keeping them, you know, paying for them to live in prison for years and years and years when you could probably just eliminate the problem"
sv,maybe spend the money on someone who could possibly be helped
aap_am,"that might be true,"
%,"um, i'm, -"
qh,"what i don't know, is where do we draw the line"
b,right
qy,"uh, do we say that every one who commits murder in the first degree is liable for capital punishment if that's what the jury decides is an appropriate punishment for their crime,"
qrr,or do we extend it beyond that?
b,"uh-huh,"
br,beyond murder or just beyond like first degree murder?
no,"well, either, you know"
sd,"uh, i have a, a nine year old daughter,"
sv,"and there are some crimes that could be committed against her that are not even considered capital crimes, that, that i would consider basis for murder"
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sv,well that really gets into a sticky issue
sd,"uh, i could see that too"
sv,"i think there's probably things i could think of short of murder that someone, i think someone would probably deserve to be killed for"
ba,"but, gosh,"
qh,"and who's going to decide which is how bad, you know, -"
sv,"something that to you is really bad might not be quite so bad to me,"
sv,"and, uh, it's gets into a pretty sticky issue"
aa,"yes,"
aa,it does
sv,"a lot of that has to do with the cultures that we grew up in and what's termed acceptable and, um, to what's allowable and where are we"
b,right
sv,"uh, you know, if we were, lived in a different country, then murder is not so bad"
b, yeah
sv,"but over here, where we're promised the civil liberties of purs-, life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, then taking that away is a, a heinous act"
b,"yeah,"
^2,in some eyes
sv,i think some people give up that 
sv,"i think some of what we consider rights are really more privileges than, than what most people think of them as"
sd,"i don't know what, um, texas's criteria for capital murder is, do, capital punishment is,"
qy,do you know?
qy,"are there some set guidelines, like only under these circumstances?"
h,i don't know
sv,"i believe it's, uh, at the discretion of the judge or jury"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i used to live in virginia,"
sd,"and i know when they first reinstated capital punishment it was only, um, if someone killed a police officer or someone committed rape and then murder"
sv,"those were the only two circumstances where you could give someone the death penalty, which i think is a little too limited"
aa,i tend to agree with you there
sv,"um, my belief is that, is that, um, any crime that's freely committed, you know -"
%,freedom of choice -
b,uh-huh
sv," these people had a choice of committing this crime, that involves the taking of another's life or the altering of someone's life "
b,yeah
sd,but then i'm also told that i'm a pretty harsh person
b," yeah,"
sd,"in general terms i'm not so harsh,"
sd,"but then whenever i hear of a specific case, you know, where someone did something, then it's like, yeah, put it to them "
sd,"so, i think i probably tend to be a little bit harsh, too, as far as that goes"
%,"because, -"
%,"yeah,"
aa,"i think you're right,"
sv,"that person voluntarily gives up when they decide to commit that crime,"
sv,"they voluntarily give up their right to continue on with their happy life,"
%,"just beca-, you know, -"
sv,they ruin someone else's life
b,"all right,"
sd,i can see a difference between a person who goes out to rob a store for food 
b,right
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, that second group of people falls into the group that i say give up their rights,"
sd,"the, the first guy, you know i just assumed it was a guy, the first person,"
b,right
b,"yeah,"
aa,that's right
%,"or with the, -"
qh,"what about, uh, like teenagers that get involved in a gang and do a drive by shooting or something like that say fifteen, sixteen year old"
qy,"would you consider, uh, capital punishment for them?"
sv,i think i would probably lower the age to about fourteen
b, uh-huh
%,"there's some, -"
h,"and i, i certainly don't know myself,"
sv,"but somebody needs to do a study that says at what age true and complete logical thought to include the, the consideration of, of long term consequences "
b,right
b,"yeah,"
^2,"what age they're accountable,"
sd,"and, uh, well he's nineteen now,"
sd,"and i don't think that i saw it in him until maybe last year,"
sd,"and i have an eleven year old and a nine year old,"
sd,"and i don't, don't see it in them yet,"
sd,"but i'm, i'm not sure where it begins"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i know that they are lowering the age of, uh, whatever is considered a minor"
sv,"i think the kids, certain kids have been tried as adults who were a lot younger than they used to be,"
%,"like, -"
sd,"i think i read about a boy that was nine or ten, that got mad at some playmates and went in and got a gun and just opened fire on them,"
sd,"and they were trying to charge him as a, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",all right
qw,"what, what changes do you think have taken place in the last generation?"
sv,i guess the biggest one is number of women in the work force
b,yeah
sv,"few are, uh, basically staying home and being homemakers, and raising kids exclusively"
aa,uh-huh
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"i, i, i grew up in, uh, sixties and early seventies"
sd,"and, uh, my mom didn't work at all when i was growing up"
sd,"she didn't start working until i was, um, well into high school"
b,uh-huh
sv,"so, i, i had the advantage of having a mom at home that nowadays kids, it's a luxury item for mothers to be home with their kids"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,true
sd,"well, mine taught kindergarten"
sd,"but she was always, uh, -"
sd,i guess her schedule was shorter
sd,"so she was always, uh,"
^2, always home by the time you got home 
%,yeah
%,"yeah,"
sv,"that, that statistic i guess has been growing every year"
sd," it's like something around sixty, sixty-five percent or so now"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, i'm not sure what the future holds for that"
%,"whether, -"
sv,"it seems like there's, it seems that there's a grass roots, um, effort or whatever going on"
sd,"i, i, um, clean houses part-time,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and almost all the people that i clean for, believe it or not, are mothers that don't work "
b,huh
b,"um,"
ba, that's unusual 
%," they are, th-, they're all, um, -"
sv,"it's, and it's, i think it's kind of a new movement"
sv,"it's going back towards, you know, -"
sd,"women have come into the work force in the last twenty, thirty years"
sv,"and now they're wanting to go back to the old days where, you know, women stayed home with the kids, you know, and try to give the kids quality time"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and i, i think that in the future you're, i think you're going to see a lot more, um, women choosing to not work after they have a baby"
b,yeah
sv,"um, i think with, uh, the, uh, the work force with the, the salaries that -"
sd,"a lot of, a lot of the women that i work for have husbands who are, um, vice-presidents of companies"
sv,"and i think with, uh, um, this, it seems like it's more the upper-class people,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," um, i don't see it as much, the, like in my situation where i don't, i don't have children yet,"
sd,but ideally i would like to be able to stay home with my kids
sv,"but realistically that's, i'm, i'm realizing that's probably not going to be possible, um, for middle-class people to be able to live just on one income"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,that is tough
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"we're looking at that now,"
sd,my wife's about six months along
b,uh-huh
sv,i think it's going to be a luxury item to be able to stay home with your kids
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, it's going to kind of kind of go along with the b m w in the driveway and, or in the garage or whatever"
ba,true
sv,"um, and the quarter of a million dollar home or whatever"
aa,yeah
sd,i'm surprised that the main people you work for are women that do stay home
sv,i would think it would be women that were working full-time
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"believe it or not though the, all the women that stay home are real busy when they are home"
b,huh
sv,"um, they're real active in volunteer work"
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, one of the women is real active with, uh, muscular dystrophy and, uh, does a lot of, of work with them on a volunteer basis"
sv,"but it's still, it's almost like a job,"
sd,she just doesn't get paid for it
sv,"huh well, i guess that's good that they, they've got something to keep them active"
aa,yeah
qy,"when, when your wife has her baby, is she going to stay home"
qrr,"or is she going to,"
ny," yeah,"
sd,"we're, "
qo,<<very faint>> what do you think?
%,"that, that, that, -"
sd,"i would, i would like to be able to do that"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"we think it's, uh, that important"
sd,"and i, i kind of hope that the trend goes back in that direction"
sd,"i'm a, a counselor and a therapist,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and i work with adolescents,"
sd,and i see some of the problems the kids have when they don't have a real good family structure
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i, i see a difference in the generation of, even the generation before me,"
b, uh-huh 
sv,"where the, the attitudes were a lot different"
sv,"um, as far as, i think the kids back then seemed to be a lot more, -"
sv,"um, ther-, there wasn't a lot of the drugs and alcohol and,"
b, uh-huh 
sv,"i think morally, um, it seems like there was, peo-, people were a lot better back then as far as hig-, higher standards"
ba,true
sv,"well, the husbands' roles are almost nonexistent in family anymore in terms of being the father figure"
sv,and with women working so much they're kind of pulled out of it too
b,yeah
sv,"so, kids are raised around their friends and by the media"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sv,"and that's, you know, that's contributed,"
sv,"and i think, i think you're going to see a lot more of that in the future"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"maybe that's contributed to a lot of the problems that we see all the time,"
sv,"so if there was some way for, for women to, to stay home even if they could work, you know,"
sv,"there are a lot of jobs that are coming about, like in computers at home,"
b, uh-huh 
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"i, i think that, um, in the future, um, the, the family unit as it, as it once was known, is, is going to be nonexistent < >"
qo,"what, how do you, what do you think?"
qw,about?
%,that as far as -
qy,"do-, do you think there's going to be still a family unit"
qrr,"or, or do you think that, um, the trend is going more towards single parenting?"
%,the balance -
%,"i don't, -"
sd,"the, the divorce rate keeps hovering around fifty percent or so"
sd,and it got higher than that for a while
sv,"um, that's hard to say"
sv,families are such a strange configuration anymore
sd,"um, i, i see a lot of families where, -"
%,"you know, in the, in the back, -"
sd,"i grew up about the same time you did,"
b, uh-huh 
sv, and back in those times we pretty much were taught how to be responsible
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, nowadays it's not the case,"
sv,"kids don't, kids are bombarded with all kinds of junk"
sv,"and one of the reasons, i guess, is because there's so much more income in the family with both parents working"
sv,they get bombarded with junk
sv,and they don't have to do anything around the house
sv,"they never learned to be responsible when, -"
b, yeah 
sv, the bigger trend called the boomerang kids where they move out for a while -
sv,"and they come back,"
sv,and you got twenty and thirty year olds who are living at home with mom and dad 
%,"so, -"
b, yeah 
sv," you know, you create a bigger, bigger family, generation after generation but not really on purpose"
b,yeah
sv,"so it's not, not a real functional situation anyway"
sd,"so, you know, i don't know it's, i don't know that that trend's going to change the single parent type families"
sv,"and the families, as long as we've got so many other crazy things going on in society"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i, i think that eventually the, the family unit's just not going to even exist anymore"
sv," like you said the divorce rate is getting so high that i think there's going to be more single parent families than there are, um, you know, two parent families"
b,uh-huh
ba,that's pretty sad
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"it is,"
sv,"i guess unless, unless there's a, a major swing in the change of what's important to people, you know, probably keep going downhill"
h,"and i, i don't know"
sv,"we, we feel like that, that we can make it on one income"
sv,"it, it may be tough"
sv,"but we may have to give up on some, some things"
sv,"i, i think in the long run though your child will benefit from that"
b,yeah
sv,"and it will, it will make the, the strain worthwhile"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,i think so too
fc,"well, i, i need to go ahead and, and wrap it up"
fc,okay
fc,"um, it was really nice talking to you"
fc,"well, i've enjoyed it, stephanie"
fc,"and, uh, thanks a lot"
fc,uh-huh
fc,"okay,"
fc,bye-bye
fc,bye-bye
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay, um,"
^h,let's see
qo,how do you feel about credit cards?
sd," personally, i do not care for them uh, although i find them a necessity in business and so forth,"
sd,"i, i try to refrain from their use as much as possible um, for a number of reasons, one of which is the, you know, extreme interest rate on most of them"
b,uh-huh
sd,"the one i use, uh, of course, for mostly, only for business purposes is, uh, you know, american express"
b,right
sd,"and, uh, i'm not i'm not terribly in favor of them"
sd,"not for my own personal, uh, point of view"
b,right
sd,"plus it, uh, has, you know, from an economic point of view it has increased our debt "
b,yeah
b,right
ba,wow
sd," uh, at least that's one number for this range of numbers i have, i have heard"
b,right
qy,do you use them frequently
%,"or, -"
sd,"well, we, uh, me and my wife, when, when we have like extra money that we know we're going to have, and we can put it in our budget, yeah, we'll, we'll use it"
sd,"but like last year, i think we paid, -"
sd,"i think it was like twenty something cents interest,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i think this, this year we, uh, i think we used it for christmas,"
sd,and we got caught just a few days on our grace period
sd,"and, uh, so we'll pay a little interest this year, but maybe two dollars"
sd,but we don't like to do that at all
b,yes
sd,"and, you know, we, i think we feel about the same way you do real strongly"
sd,"we, uh, we have several credit cards, though"
sd,"we have a gas card, our visa, and then, of course, the american express,"
sd,and i think we have a couple of department stores
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, we use it the same way,"
%,"and, uh, -"
sd,"i find the one i use mostly, uh, -"
sd,"aside from the american express, i do use my sears card"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, i try, a-, as with the american express, i try to pay it, you know, as it comes in"
b,right
b,right
%,"so, uh, -"
sd,"it's, it's not uncommon for us to have paid it before we even get the bill"
sd,that's usually how we do it
sd,"i know when i travel, or when i used to travel overseas quite a bit, what i would do on my american express card is before i would, before i left i would mail a check to, to american express "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, for hotels and, and so forth"
sd,"but, uh, but i knew that it was paid "
sd,i knew 
b,right
b,yeah
sd,"sometimes, you know, sometimes i would go over,"
sd,"but it wouldn't, you know, it wouldn't hit me in a big, in a big way because "
b,right
b,right
ba,that's good
sd,"i've, i don't think we've gone that far ,"
sv,"but, i guess if you foresaw that you were going to have to use it, that, like that,"
sd,"well, i found "
b,uh-huh
b,oh really
b,yeah
sd,"plus i would, uh, when they, uh, would send the bill, they would automatically convert to the exchange rate"
b,"right,"
b,right
sd,"so, now, the only time that got to be a problem was, if the exchange rate changed drastically"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, for example, i remember on one trip to france when i started planning the trip, i think, uh, a dollar was worth nine or ten"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and whe-, when i finally got over there, it had fallen, uh, two or three francs to the dollar"
%,"so the , -"
ba,wow 
sd,"so, i got caught a little short "
ba,wow
sd,"but, uh "
b,yeah
sd,"if it were, say sixty or seventy francs a night "
b,right
sd,maybe it would be more than that
sd,it was more than
sd,it would average out to thirty-five or forty dollars a night 
b,right
b,right
sd,but then when i got back and i was working for the government at the time -
b,uh-huh
sd," of course the government was several months behind in,"
b,"right,"
b,yeah
b,right
sd,"so there's a little consternation, you know, in trying to get them to compensate,"
b,yeah
aa,right
aa,yeah
%,"especially, -"
sd, that was the only time i really got caught short
sd,"and i,"
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
ba,"well tha-, that's good"
qw,"well, from where are you calling?"

bk,"oh, okay"
sd,"so, when i heard that jack was going to do this, i called him and asked for an application where i could participate "
b,"yeah,"

b,yeah
sv,"you have a very, um, very, -"
t1,what's the word

sd,i work in 
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,yeah
sd,i guess we're supposed to do this part of it before we started the recording

qo,"so, uh, what things do you consider an invasion of privacy?"
no,"ooh, well i don't know"
qo,what do you think?
no,"oh, i don't know"
sd,i had a little bit more time to think about it
sd,"i was thinking of, like, uh, -"
h," i don't know,"
sd,"i was ju-, started to think about all the big, you know, data bases they have with all the information about you on them like the credit reports "
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
h,"and i don't know,"
sd,"i don't know how much the stuff actually, what they actually have in there"
sv,but 
b,huh
qo," well what about, uh, required drug testing, uh, as a, uh, condition of employment?"
^h," yeah,"
sd,"that was, that, that was the other one i was thinking of "
%,"i think that's, uh, -"
sd,i mean i know drugs are illegal 
%, it thing actually -
sd,"uh, i, uh, have worked at texas instruments"
b, huh uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, they instituted a drug policy there drug testing policy where they randomly would test, uh, employees "
b,uh-huh
sd," and actually, to tell you the truth, i really did not think much about it"
sd,"i, i hadn't, you know,"
sd,it really didn't relate to me
qh,"but there were some things that people brought up like well what happens if they, they get a false positive, you know, what recourse do you have"
b, uh-huh
sv,"and, also, uh, uh, this is against the law for the government to do this kind of thing, this kind of big brother activity"
sv,"and yet, uh, a lot of these large corporations such as texas instruments, although they don't admit to it, it's actually, oh, a drug testing policy comes about as a result of government pressure"
b,uh-huh
sv,"so what that means is, to me, that really it's the government that's requiring this,"
sv,"although they don't actually e-, execute it themselves, it's really the government that -"
sv,"so, in that sense, it, at least, philosophically, it's really borderline legal"
b,uh-huh
sv,"well i, i think the, i think that, you know, a person's competence should be more determined by, you know, their actions and their behavior"
sv,"and if they're, you know, if they're on some kind of, you know, contol-, controlled substance then, you know, it kinds of takes away from the job of, you know, the supervisor or manager type person, you know, who is able to evaluate them"
sv,"i think they should be evaluated that way rather than with a, you know, a chemical, you know, "
qh," well, what about this, uh, aids epidemic now?"
sv,"where you find that, uh, uh, you know, certain people are actually are, are criminal in their disregard for it-, "
qy, these people that are carriers and don't 
%," yeah,"
sv,and 
sv,"it, uh, it destroys their libido"
sv," yeah, tha-, that would be kind of an extreme"
%,"now, uh, you know if they ever, -"
sd," i mean i've heard of things like, you know, making them, you know, marking them somehow or, you know, or something like that or, you know, putting them all someplace like in a kind of, -"
qo, so what about that as an invasion of privacy?
^h,yeah
sv,"wel-, i guess it kind of borders on where, i mean what do you value more the invasion of, uh, the person's privacy or the possible danger to, you know, other people"
b,"so really,"
bf,"it i-, gets to balancing, uh, personal freedom against, uh, the general welfare "
aa,yeah
sv,"i guess that's alwa-, that's been the big role of government, i guess i mean generally "
sv," well, it, it's supposed to have been"
aa,yeah
aa, yeah
sv,"well, that's kind of a difficult one to go into"
sv,"i mean that, that particular case"
ar," no,"
%,"it , -"
sv,"because i mean, there's a lot of people that, uh, i mean they could require, you know, ob-, obligatory aids testing for everyone because i'm, you know, there's a huge part of the population,"
sv,"not a huge part but a, you know -"
^2,a growing part
sv," the aids population i guess that have it, that don't know they do "
b,uh-huh
sv,"but, again, to require, you know, such a test and jus-, and then to make, make it is to subject them to, to discrimi-, discriminatory practices and other things"
h,"i don't know,"
sd,"uh, i don't know how exactly i feel about that"
sv, maybe chop their weenies off
sd,i guess we're ready to talk
fp,"how you doing, howard?"
sd,"this is a, a subject that i'm not real well versed on,"
%,but -
ad,"well, let's talk about air pollution"
aa,okay
qw,what do you think causes air pollution in dallas?
qw,or where are you from?
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",no
qy^d,maybe you're not in dallas
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sd,"i'm from the, uh, -"
sd,i'm from dallas
sd,i'm in richardson
bk,"okay uh,"
qo,what do you think as far as air pollution in the dallas area?
sd,"well, i have some small experience in this area"
sd,the brown haze that you see if you look down central towards downtown 
b,right
sd,"but, uh, the, one of the major problems that dallas has is oxides and nitrogen"
sd,"that's because of all the equipment that's being operated but at the same time, uh, because we don't have, we don't burn a lot of coal and solid materials we,"
sd,now particulates would come from trash burning or incineration or something like that here in dallas
b,right
sd,"uh, power plants since, -"
sd,"many of our local power plants, uh, are natural gas most of the time, uh, the things that come off of those plants are carbon dioxide, and n o x"
sd,"there's no particulates in natural gas, of course"
sd,and we pick up a little bit of sulphur off some of these products
sd,"we're burning fuel oil and a few other things,"
sd,"but gasoline, of course, now the lead's out, at least theoretically, uh, i guess you could say we're picking up some sulphur because a lot of the fuels does have sulphur"
sd,that's why we get that rotten egg smell sometime off the catalytic converter 
bh,"oh, really?"
sd,"and that's, uh, course hydrogen sulfide, which is when you burn gasoline, you also produce some water vapor "
b,sure
sd,and under the right condition you get h two s
%,"but, anyway, uh, -"
sv,"well, you are, you are well versed on the subject, i tell you"
bd,"well, i don't know"
sd,this is not one of my better ones
sd,"i guess, i guess i notice it the most just, uh, in driving around dallas with all the, the highway equipment that's working on the "
b,uh-huh
sd,that's where i see most of it
%,"ro-, -"
sd,"uh, ron a lot of this is caused by the fact that cars sitting in traffic tend to run rich because the way the pollution is"
b,right
sd,"and when they run rich they, they spit out a lot of hydrocarbons,"
sd,and that's another part of the problem
sd,the gas is not being burned completely
sd,"but, uh, hopefully, if we ever get our road system fixed up, this will get a lot better"
sd,"oh, i don't know, i've lived here since seventy-four, howard,"
sd,"and, i d-, i think, i think they been working on the highways around here since i've been here,"
sv,"and i think, i think they'll be working on them long after my wife and i are gone"
sd,"well, i guess, i, not trying to top you, but i grew up in dallas county and i can remember when they built the north part of north central which was built after the south part of "
b,right 
sd,"and, uh, i can remember coming over the hill down there long about, uh, i don't know, little bit north of mark-, mockingbird on up in, over those hills"
sd,and i said i wonder if they'll ever need this road
sd,"course, it was designed for most of us to go about forty-five miles an hour because the short on ramps and are, off ramps,"
ba,"but, gosh,"
sv,"seems like, uh, those ramps might kill us yet"
%,"i, -"
sd,hopefully the new ones will be a lot better
ba,i understand
sd,"i sure hope so, i tell you"
sd,"you know, you get out on the, uh, interstate highways versus, -"
sd,i travel quite a bit
sd,"and traveling from, like, dallas to austin to san antonio it's the same thing as far as the pollution created by the automobiles in the, in the stalled traffic and the busy highways, you, you, you're at your best"
sd,"and, i guess when you're out on the interstate, heading north or south and you're just cruising right along and there's no build up of cars"
%,"and, -"
b,"yeah,"
qy,"ron, have you noticed when you're driving south on thirty-five, i guess towards waxahachie, hillsborough on down to austin,"
ny,yes
sd,"right along in there somewhere, suddenly the air feels cleaner"
qy,have you noticed that?
ng,"i tell you what, i, i don't think i really have,"
sd,but i'm going that way tuesday
oo_co_cc,and i'm going to make it a point to
sd,"well, sometimes it depends on which way the winds blowing "
b,sure
sd," but, uh, i also travel a little bit"
sd,"and, uh, i don't know, it just seems like there's a certain point down there where you can breathe easier"
sd,it may be all in my mind
aa,"oh, i know"
sd,"i know going to, uh, uh, -"
sd,"i detest going to houston because it's such a, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","uh, greg,"
sd,"uh, i, i'm not familiar"
qy,"i think, uh, you guys in indiana, don't you have the, the death penalty?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,we do have the death penalty here
sd,"it's not exercised very often,"
sd,but we do have it
b,uh-huh
sd,"i believe it, -"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i know there's a lot of, lot of problems with it,"
sv,"but, uh "
b,uh-huh
aa,right
sd,"but, i know there's a lot of problems with that, like, well, they say, okay, if you declare someone, put them on death row and execute them, well, then ten years later you find out that he really didn't do it, then that life was wasted,"
sv,but 
b,uh-huh
aa,uh-huh
aa,"uh, i, i tend to agree with you,"
sd,"uh, i've changed my views over, uh, e-, even within the last few years, uh, to be honest"
sd,"uh, uh, when i was in coll-, when i was an undergraduate, i was a member of amnesty international "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, and, of course, at that time, you know, i thought, uh, uh, it was stupid to kill anybody for, uh, -"
%,"you know, that -"
sv,the eye for an eye was a stupid argument
aa,right
sv,"but the, uh, the more, -"
sd,"now i live in downtown dallas,"
sd,"and i, uh, "
b,right
b,right
sv," i think that maybe, uh, a good solution to capital punishment might be, uh, reserve it solely for, uh, repeat offenders of a crime like, uh, murder"
aa,"that's a, that's a thought that i had never really had on that "
b,"yeah,"
sv,it seems sensible and failsafe
%,"i, i, uh, i don't, -"
sv,"you know, not completely failsafe,"
sv,"but if a man's convicted of two murders, uh, you know, there's a pretty good chance that something's wrong"
aa,right
%,"uh i also, uh, -"
sv,"to tell you how liberal i have turned, uh, toward this, or, or, or whatever side that is "
b,right
b, yeah
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,"and i think, i think the death penalty is the best choice for those people, because, uh, really any kind of, uh, uh, jail sentence for them is just another chance to, uh, create another power structure "
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"you're, you're right there"
%,"uh, i gue-, -"
sd,"basically my views, i guess they tend to be more economically oriented "
b,uh-huh
b,right
b,right
sv,"i mean, i don't believe that the prison system that we have today does much towards rehabilitation to begin with "
b,right
sv," so to me i'm paying taxes, you know, twenty percent of my check or whatever "
b,uh-huh
sv,"so i, i'm all in favor of it"
b,uh-huh
qy,"well, uh, do you, uh, -"
qy,"are there cases where you think that, that, uh, the capital, the capital punishment shouldn't be, uh, uh, sentenced?"
h,"well, i, i really don't know on that question"
sv,"it just seems like, -"
sv,"for instance, the jeffrey dahlmer case i mean, i don't really think that this person is going to ever be a worthwhile part of society"
sv,i hope the guy never gets back out on the streets 
b,uh-huh
sd," and in that case, wisconsin doesn't have a death penalty,"
sd,so he's going to be sentenced to life imprisonment 
b,right
sv," and i think that, that he should not be allowed to live,"
sv,"but, you know, then you're kind of playing god "
aa,"that's true,"
aa,yeah
aa,right
sd,"but cases where i think the death penalty should be withheld, uh, not really that i can think of"
sv,"i, i would, i would be in favor of the death penalty in things like, you know, murders, and like you said, repeat murders or "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
ar," uh, i don't really agree with the, uh, death penalty for people like noriega and such as that"
sv,"i think that they're, they're operating on a more, -"
sv,"i mean, i know that they're causing massive problems in society up here,"
sv,"but i don't really think that, that it's, it's in our power to take these people from a sovereign state and say you don't deserve to live, because "
b,right
b,"sure,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i understand, i understand your point"
%,yeah
qy^d,"uh, of course, you know, with, uh, with, with dahlmer now, uh, you, you realize that ohi-, i think it's ohio, uh, gets to try him next"
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd," so, uh, that was a curious case"
%,i -
b,"yeah,"
sd,that is very curious
sv,"uh, uh, something is sort of nightmarish "
aa,yeah
aa,"that's, that's right"
sd,"uh, well, here in texas we, uh, -"
sd,"i think even, even this last week, last week they had another, they, uh, -"
sd,"you know, they use their capital punishment by lethal injection, uh, uh,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sd,it's pressed
qy,are you still there?
na,i'm ready 
bk,okay 
qw,"so what's, uh, things that you look for when you go out to dinner?"
sd,"oh, i just like a nice, quiet, nice atmosphere "
b,uh-huh
sd,"that's always, that's always a concern, but just a nice quiet easy place "
b,huh
%,so -
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, we don't go out to dinner that much either"
sd,we try to get out maybe like once every month and a half or 
b,uh-huh
sd,"but i definitely want to go to a place that's nice and clean, you know"
b,right
sd,"um, i've been to some that's been terrible"
sv,"you know, you see cockroaches crawling around and "
b,oh 
sd,but i try to get one that's nice and clean
sd,"and then i like to, you know, good food and good service"
b,yeah
%,so -
b,"yeah,"
sv,"where you don't feel rushed, you know "
b,"yeah,"
b,right
sv," and you can just relax, and "
b,"right,"
b,right
qy,so is there some nice places to go to eat in plano?
na,"well, nearby"
sd,we're almost in dallas
sd,we're just north of dallas
b,uh-huh
sd,so we have quite a bit between us and there
sd,it's about ten miles 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd, and there is all kinds of restaurants
sd,"and, i had one that was a favorite for a long time,"
sd,and then it changed hands and doubled the prices
sd,and then it finally went out of business
b,um
sd,"so, but it was really nice"
sd,it had a fireplace
ba,"um, that sounds beautiful"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,it was really nice
sd,they had entertainment sometimes
sd,and 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,well
sd,but it's gone 
%,"uh, we have, uh, -"
sd,"excuse me, i didn't think my coughing would come back"
sd,"anyhow, we have only like one, uh, restaurant that's kind of nice"
sd,"you know, they have prime rib on, uh, weekends "
b,uh-huh
sd," and then they have about six miles from here is called, a little city called wesley,"
sd,"and they have a wesley hotel there that they serve food,"
sd,"and the atmosphere there is really, really nice"
ba,"oh, that's nice"
sd,"so, and then if we really want to, you know, something different we go to modesto "
b,uh-huh
b,right
sd,"but, uh, we don't have any fast foods here in this small city "
sv,that is probably very fortunate for you
qy,do you have kids?
br,do i have kids?
ny,yeah
na,"well, i have a son,"
sd,but he's grown up
sd,"oh, because i have a twelve year old that would eat a happy meal every night, you know,"
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
sd," so something's happened here,"
sd,"but, but, um, you know, mcdonald's is definitely at the top of her list,"
sd,and i hate these places
b,yeah
qy,"all the kids seem to love mcdonald's don't they, you know"
ny,"uh-huh,"
na,"they do,"
sv,and i don't think there's an ounce of nutritional value in anything they have
aa,"no,"
aa,"no,"
sd,i'm sure there isn't
sd,"well, we have all kinds of fast foods everywhere around "
b,uh-huh
sv," and it's really, it's tempting when you come home from work"
sv,and you're tired
sv,"and, you know, you just are tempted to give in to that,"
sv,and it costs a lot of money to do it too
ba, i know 
sv," you know, it adds up"
sv,"and it's not healthy,"
sd,"and i really got into that habit for a while,"
sd,but i got out of it again because 
b,yeah
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
%,so -
qw,"well, let's see, what else can we talk about? "
qo," well, how's california today? "
sd,"oh, it's foggy and cold here"
bh,is it?
sd,"that's what i've heard, yeah"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
%,and it's -
qy,have you always lived there?
na,i came from iowa when i was sixteen 
bk,oh
sd," so i've lived out in california for a long, long time"
qy^d,and you like it?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i like it real well
b,"yeah,"
%,we've been
sd,"we used to live in oakland,"
sd,so we used to have a lot more restaurants to go to there 
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,"but, uh, then i quit work and everything"
sd,and i bought a house
sd,"i had a condo in oakland,"
sd,"so, right in chinatown, so we went to lots of restaurants "
ba,"oh, that would be fun"
sd,"and they were really good,"
sd,i really miss them you know 
b, yeah
qy, do you miss living there?
nn,"uh, no,"
sd,i really don't miss 
b^m, no 
sd, i just like to go in there and have a nice chinese 
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, as far as missing living there, no"
%,um
sd,"it's close enough if i wanted to go there, to san francisco for dinner or something, why, you know, an hour and fifteen minutes we could be there and "
b,yeah
qy,"but, uh, have you ever been to california?"
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,i go all the time
bh,oh really?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,well i have a twenty-one year old daughter in college there 
%,um
sd," and she, um, is a world champion twirler "
b,uh-huh
sd, and her coach is in california
sd,so she went there for six years
%,um
sd,so i went out a lot with her
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
ny,"and, uh, yeah,"
sd,i know california pretty well
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i love it, "
sd,and 
sd,but i think he's going to move because i'm the person with more to lose here
b,uh-huh
sd,i have my twelve year old in school 
b,uh-huh
sd, and she's happy
sd,"she always lived here in the south,"
sd,"and i have my house,"
sd,so 
b,uh-huh
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
qw,what do you think of the public school system?
qy,"first off, do you have children that are in it?"
na,i have children that are in the plano public school systems
sd,"and i am a substitute teacher at this point looking for a full-time job in the public school,"
bk," oh, okay "
%,"so, -"
sv,"well then, you should be a good one to know because i, my children are grown now"
sd,"i now have grandchildren,"
b, oh 
sd,"so, uh, i don't have firsthand experience right now,"
b," uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh 
qo,so what do you think?
sv,"well, i think the public school systems are doing a good job"
sv,i think they have a long way to go yet
sv,"but i think that, um, they are starting to head towards more technology and getting the kids computer literate earlier"
sd,"you know, my kindergartners were on the, were on the computers,"
sv,and i think that with the way the world is today that's got to be done
sv,"and i think that, uh, the schools now are starting to teach thinking strategies more than just giving them, you know, skills"
b, right 
sv,you figure out why you're adding it and what you're going to do with it once you've got it together
sv,"and i think that that's something that is drastically needed because most of these kids cannot think,"
sv,they literally cannot come in out of the rain
aa, that's right 
%,"you know, and that just, -"
sv,i don't care how intelligent you are if you be cannot make it function for you that intelligence is being wasted
b, right 
sd," and, uh, this has been one of my pet peeves and probably why i went into education"
sv,"so i think, you know, they're, they're trying to head them into teaching them to think and use the education that they have,"
sv,"and i think that's very, very important"
aa,"yes,"
aa,it is
sv,"i, i agree with you that they're starting children so much earlier on things because our grandchildren, -"
sd,"we have a, uh, fourth grader"
sd,and then we have one that's in kindergarten
sd,"and, and i know the fourth grader is doing stuff that our children was doing, were doing in the fifth and sixth grade"
b,"oh, yeah"
b," oh, yeah "
sd,i tutor a girl that's in eighth grade
sd,"and her pre-algebra book is higher then some of my algebra two,"
qy, is that scary?
sd," and it's like, oh, i going to take this home and study it before i can help you"
b, right 
sd," you know, so they're really, they're really moving them along"
sd,"but yet, at the same time, you know, they are stopping and making them use it and function with it like they would need to do in everyday life"
%," now, -"
%," and that's wha-, you know, -"
sd,a lot of the things that we did in school i've never used and never will use
b,yes
sv,"and, uh, so i think that it's, it's appropriate to teach them, you know, why they are learning this not just because the teacher says you have to learn this"
aa, correct
qy,"are you finding that, uh, since you're doing substitute, that you're wanting to do full-time?"
sd,"um, i have a friend that's a teacher that one of her complaints is she can't teach because she's so busy filling out all the forms"
ny,"yes,"
%," that's a, -"
%," and, and d-, -"
qy,"are you, do you find that?"
sd," well, filling out the forms and also all of these, uh, statewide and national wide testing,"
b, uh-huh 
sv,"and you know, you can as far as i'm concerned you can make a survey or test scores say anything you want it to say"
b,uh-huh
sd,and it's just a matter of how you're going to interpret it
sv,"and you waste so much time quote, unquote teaching to the test to make sure that your scores are the very best they're possibly going to be,"
%," be, -"
b,uh-huh 
sd,"you know, the fir-, the whole first nine weeks of school is, is used as a review"
sd,"but more than a review they're getting those kids primed and ready for the tests that are coming up in,"
^2," coming up,"
b,uh-huh 
sv,and i think that's totally useless
sv,"i think, you know, there's a place and a time for all of the tests and comparisons"
sv,but i think they've taken it to the extent now that it's just ridiculous
sv,it's like bragging on your grandchildren
b,right 
sv,"you know, and everybody's kids are the best kids that have ever hit this earth"
sv,"and nobody else's children are going to ever live up to this,"
sd,and that's great
sv,but that's what they're doing with the school systems
sv,"and they're wasting too much time on that, i think "
sd," well, i, i know that this again this, this friend,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and she teaches, uh, uh, it mus-, uh, emotionally disturbed children"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and she says she has, um, six graders in there that are reading on the level of the second grade"
b,yes
sv,but because evidently you receive a certain amount of money when they're passed on or something
h,i didn't quite understand it
b,"yeah,"
%,"there's a, -"
%,yeah
%," and, uh, -"
sv," the bottom line is always money,"
qy,"well, have you ever served on a jury?"
nn,"no,"
sd,i've not
sd,"i've been called,"
sd,but i had to beg off from the duty
qy,and you?
na,"well, i was called"
sd,and then i was not chosen
%,um
sv,"well, i was, i was, uh, originally chosen primarily, i think, because i was a young fellow"
sv,and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict
sd,i don't know why
sd,something i picked up in a psychology class some time ago
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason,"
sd,and they kind of liked me
sd,"i looked conser-, and all that stuff"
%,"and they, -"
sd,"i don't know what they saw in me,"
sd,but they saw it
sd,"but, uh, back to the issue, is, uh, -"
h,"i don't know,"
sv,"at times i feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun"
sv,"but, there, too, there are also cases in which i feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, i think in civil cases"
sv,"in criminal cases, i'd like to see the unani-, unanimity remain,"
sv,"but in civil cases, i think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient"
qo,"well, uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that?"
sv,"well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such i think there ought to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this"
sd,"and in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that"
sv,"a majority rule, i think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases"
h,i don't know if i'm making any sense or not
sv,"well, i mean, i think, -"
qy,"are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, uh, tangible"
%,"or, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sv,often there's more incriminating evidence
ad,"like, for instance, say, uh, -"
sv,"and also, too, i think i'm, i'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, uh, serious in a criminal case"
qy,"well, do you think that, that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up?"
^h,"um, well, i really can't say for certain, truth be known"
sv,"uh, as it stands, there's, there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, uh, in a civil, uh, civil and criminal case"
sv,"i mean, the, uh, documentary, the thin blue line pretty much demonstrated that"
qy^d,"you know, i don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not"
nn,"no,"
sd,i'm not
sd,"a, uh, fellow when he was much younger, uh, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death"
sd,"fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked"
sd,"and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the thin blue line that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system"
sd,the case was reopened
sd,and he was exonerated
sv,"well, i mean, i think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"many laws, but little justice"
%,"say, -"
%,"but, uh, -"
sv,"and i also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective"
aa,"oh, certainly not,"
aa,certainly not
sv,"and , you know, they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this,"
sv,but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires
%,"you know, the, -"
sd,because you get up
sd,"and, and they ask you a few questions,"
sd,"both sides do,"
sd,"and then you, you're either challenged which is, -"
sd,"you know, each attorney can use that as much as they like"
sd,"or, i think it's a limit now,"
sv,"they probably have a limit now,"
sd,"but, they pretty much go through that,"
sd,and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve
sd,"for me, it was financial hardship,"
sd,"so but, onto the thing, uh, i was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing"
sd,"it was always my impression that the justice himself, or herself, had the final say"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
ad,"we, we can, uh, be recorded while we talk about it"
aa,"okay,"
qy,"well is your, -"
qy,"does your city have mandatory, uh, recycling?"
nn,"no,"
sd,we don't have mandatory
sv,"we, actually, we're kind of slow up here,"
sd,and we've just started doing recycling probably last summer
sd,and it's all voluntary
sd,so that's interesting
qy,cities have a mandatory recycling?
na,"um, there, there're some places that are strongly encouraging it,"
sd,and that they city will pick it up
sd,that's been one of the arguments here
sd,i'm just sitting here looking we've got four bins of glass and plasticine <<phonetically spelled>> stuff
sd,"but we have to carry it, uh, some distance,"
sd,"and some places, um, you can sell your, uh, recyclables,"
sd,"and, for example, our church was collecting newspapers"
b,"yeah,"
sd,when i was a kid we used to collect newspapers and bring them to a recycle thing
sd,we got like a penny a pound for them
sd,"well, it turns out that so much,"
sd,"the problem in texas is that, uh, they've got so much paper now from people recycling that they've got no way to, uh, reprocess it"
ba,"oh, my,"
sd,"it requires an ex-, it requires essentially a paper mill to recycle it,"
sd,and so the value has gone down
sd,it turns out it wasn't worth for the church to do
ba,"oh, i didn't realize, -"
sv,"you would think, -"
sv,"now up here, i, i suppose they send it all back to the mill"
sd,"and there are paper mills within a couple of hundred miles of, uh -"
sd,actually there is one in northern vermont
sd,so there's probably a paper mill that's sixty miles from here
sd,"i didn't think that, -"
sv,"you know, in the large city that if the next recycling, if the next mill is more like five hundred miles away "
%,"well,"
b,"yeah,"
%,"well see, that's, -"
sd,"in, in dallas there no plan to build, -"
sd,"i think there, there's some in east texas there's some pulp mills,"
sd,"but, uh, you have to go to houston,"
sd,"and, it's interesting,"
sd,and then there's places that will buy metal
sd,and they still buy aluminum can and likes that *can cans ? likes like?
qh,"do you have to buy metal,"
sv,like copper is a very good one to collect
sv,"even aluminum,"
%,"yeah,"
%,so -
qy,"well, do you do, do you do recycling?"
na,"uh, we do the recycling,"
sd,and our city will pick up our recyclables
b,oh
sd,they have these little blue bins
sd,"um, i don't recycle personally"
sd,"i, i'm saying i want to do it,"
sd,"but, i don't get a lot of magazines,"
sd,"i don't get a, -"
sd,"i don't buy the newspaper,"
sd,"but i do have a lot of, uh, -"
sd,"my trash has a lot of tin cans and a lot of cart-, a lot of different papers and cardboards"
qy,"well, do you drink soda and such in aluminum cans?"
ny,"yes,"
sd,but we have a bottle return
sd,a lot of the northern states and a lot of the eastern states have bottles
sd,we've had five cent deposits on our bottles for years
bf,"oh, so it's worth taking them back"
sd,"well, see, we don't have -"
sd,"we have, we have most of our soft drinks are in plastic liter or two liter bottles"
sv,"oh, they should definitely get, um, the nickel returnable"
sv,"it's great for the kids, because"
sd,"see, a lot of the kids get the money from it,"
sv,"and it's great for the boy scouts running around, they knock door to door and the collect the bottles sometimes"
sd,"oh, that's it, -"
%,"you'll, you'll, -"
sd,"there is a down side to all this, you know, about no good deed going unpunished,"
sd,"and so every time i recycle newspapers, in fact there's a, there's a, uh, -"
sd,"kimberly and clark, the makers of kleenex and such "
b,yeah
sd,in fact i almost went to work for them
sd,i was offered a job and turned it down because my mother got it for me
sd,it's twenty or thirty miles from my house
sd,"every time you recycle, that's one less tree my mother can sell,"
sd,"and, uh so, it's a question should i be diligent and, um, "
^2,and recycle
b,"oh, yes,"
ba,i see that
sd,"but, it's an interesting point, though, that, you know, everybody's so anxious to recycle,"
sv,"and i suppose it does provide some gainful employment,"
%,"but, -"
^2,but it takes away employment from the resource
%,and its -
sv,"well, but in general i think it's a good idea because "
aa,"i do, too"
sd,"it doesn't biodegrade, and, and, uh, the plastics obviously,"
sd,they don't either 
sv,so we might as well recycle those
b,"yeah,"
sv,"like i say, it's not a very controversial thing"
sv,everyone thinks we should do it
sv,"it's just that we're so lazy,"
sd,"i mean, like personally, i don't want to clean my, -"
sd,i just have can cat food
sd,"i don't want to clean the can and take the label off it, and put it in a separate bin"
b,yeah
sd,"you know, i'd just rather get rid of that thing and throw it in the trash"
sd,"well, that's what we've got"
sd,"we started about, new year's we decided we'd get ambitious"
sd,"well, we took one load over there,"
sd,"and now we've got these containers filling up with stuff,"
sd,"and, you know, it's not a very high priority thing to go haul these containers over there"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i think i would be like, -"
sd,"when i bring my bottles back if they're pretty clean and stuff, so they can sit in my cellar for a couple of months, -"
sd,"and i get a whole bunch of them and bring them ov-, and bring them over"
sd,"now, if i had a recycling center and i kept it clean, like if i washed all the cans and things, i wouldn't mind if it sat around too much,"
sd,"but if, if it stunk or something i wouldn't like doing it"
sd,"but, um, i produce quite a bit of trash, -"
sd,"my, you know, house, -"
sd,"and i see it,"
sd,but i don't see so much that i can recycle
b,yeah
sd,"like i say, it's a lot of different type paper and cardboard"
sd,"i'm not a real plastic person user, but a lot of paper, um, pretty much,"
sd,and i don't know how they sort that
sd,"but if, if i used a lot of can goods and i do use a lot of laundry detergent and a lot of plastic bottles, i would think that i wou-, i would have a recycling center"
sd,"but now, it's just me and my husband,"
h,"so, i don't know"
sv,"but every little bit helps,"
^q,right
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i know what you're saying
sd,"but we have, we have a very aggressive recycling at work,"
sd,and i'm the one who will pick the newspaper out of the trash and bring it to the recycle bin
sv,"see, some people, it's, the recycle bin is on their way out"
sv,"instead of carrying your newspapers, when they get done with them at the end of the day, they throw them in the trash"
qy,"well, do you have separate trash cans at your desk"
nn,"um, no,"
sd,"we don't,"
sd,"but other, other offices do"
sd,they have a box for papers
sd,"well, we have, we have one that's recyclable and, and then for uh, lunch sacks and waste food"
sd,"and they gave us a list of things that aren't re-, -"
sd,and it turns out it's not so bad
sd,"i, i get a lot of reports that, that are covered in plastic or plas-, like saran wrap or something, anyway,"
sd,"and then, uh, cardboard, there's a few, -"
sd,"it's interesting that we're, we're recycling computer type paper"
b,yeah
sd,"and, and, uh, one day they'll pick up, uh, -"
sd,"the cleaning people come through and they'll pick up recycled paper,"
sd,"and then the next day they'll pick up the other,"
%,so -
b,oh
sd,"depending on how much, -"
sd,"you know, and there's a lot of, actually, it works pretty well,"
sd,"and then we have a, uh, waste, uh, cans for aluminum in the, in the break areas at work"
sd,"well, that's, that's a really good idea, because, um, like our, uh, fruit juices for some reason when they're in a can don't come with a deposit"
b,yeah
sv,"and they're thinking about putting a deposit on them, because pretty much you have to, you're having a whole separate recyclable bin just for these fruit cans, where they're "
b,"yeah,"
sd,"but when they sell juice, it's some strange quirk in the law, you don't have to have a deposit on it"
sd,"and even like, the, a very fine juice jar does not have to have a deposit on it,"
sd,"but if it's got soda in it, it does"
sd,"so, it's a strange"
sd,that's an interesting distinction
b,"yeah,"
sv,"they should, they should clean, clear that up"
sd,"it wouldn't take them much to put a stamp on the, uh, juice cans as easily as the soda"
b,yeah
sd,"so, but redemption centers are a big thing up here,"
sd,they get a penny a can they handle
sd,they give you five cents when they return the can to the distributor
sv,i think they either get a penny or two pennies a can
sd,"well, see, well, see, those of us that don't have state income taxes, -"
sd,yet 
b,yeah
sd,"and, it's interesting what people get upset about,"
sd,"uh, it really is"
qy,"is bot-, is bottle return down there a heated debate?"
nn,"well, no,"
bk,"oh, yeah"
sd,"well, we, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","well, here you can't drink,"
sd,"we're not civilized now, you can no longer, you cannot drink beer and drive,"
sd,but 
%,well
b,"yes,"
sd,"well, i know, i was in atlanta,"
sd,and you could walk out the bar with your drink in your hand
sd,"but here, let me put that in a paper cup for you"
sd,so that was strange
sv,"but, i think, -"
sv,"if some people they have, -"
sv,"they say, well, we're not going to start a can deposit because you have to get all these, um, the, the recycle center, you have to deal with the can and then you have to, to recycle it,"
sv,"and, their problem's already solved because they can just come to states that do have bottle deposits "
b,yeah
sd,"and see if it's a good way,"
sd,"and then do it that way because, as, like i say, people are making money on it"
sv,"well, you know, the other,"
sd,"the cans do, are worth something"
sd,"uh, well i mean i've had time to think about it because, uh, we've had, -"
%,"uh, i-, -"
%,"i-, -"
sd,there's been a great deal of difficulty in finding someone to talk to
sd,so
b,"oh, okay"
b,uh-huh
sv,some things are serious
sv,and some aren't
sv,"i guess the biggest thing that bothers me is, is, uh -"
b,uh-huh
t1," not the biggest thing, -"
sv,"but one of the things that bothers me is the credit information, uh, situation,"
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
%,"when, um, -"
sd,"i, i, i mean i, i don't know if that's an invasion of privacy, simply, i, i do t-, i do feel it is"
sd,"but i don't know whether,"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,"well what's scary is, uh, uh, about two, three, four months ago on a sun-, in the sunday edition of what is called the morning paper here, the dallas morning news"
b,uh-huh
sd,"they showed a reporter and a, um, and a copy editor how they went out"
sd,"and they just took, um, a fellow in john q public in dallas"
sd,"and all they had was, -"
sd,"let's see, they had his birth-, they had something like his birth date, the street address,"
sd,"um, they weren't even sure of the correct spelling of his last name, excuse me,"
sd,"and it was, um, very scary to see what they found out"
sd,"i mean they were able to find out what liens he still had against, you know, two or three houses, through a two divorces, children's names, locations,"
sd,"um, it was really frightening"
sv,"well i guess, i guess then it's just the big brother concept of the fact,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"i understand, uh, -"
sd,"i read the other day that, uh, these telemarketeers when someone talks to you on the phone "
b,uh-huh
b,"right,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i, i, i feel that is an invasion of privacy"
%,"but it, -"
aa,"i do too,"
%,yeah
sd,"i don't, the other thing i don't like is, um, in terms of uh, -"
sd,"like we just moved here from, uh, minneapolis"
sd,"and, uh, to get the, the very nice townhouse that we're in,"
b,yeah
sd,"you know, husband and wife, owners, um, who had never done this before"
sd,"they, um, asked us for again an astounding amount of information"
sd,"and what we really didn't have the same opportunity, -"
sv,"you know, and i guess that's when i also get upset that if you're going to do it then i want to do it too"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,exactly
sd,"um, in terms of the credit, -"
%,"yeah,"
sd,"i know, um, we're also going through adoption now,"
b,yeah
%,"in for an adoption, -"
sd,"and i mean after we gave our fingerprints n-, to the f b i, you, you,"
sv,"um, so i mean it's, it's a matter of anybody can get it any way and how if they really try, um -"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i, i have a particular subject that not everyone agrees with me, uh "
b,"uh-huh,"
ad,go ahead
%," uh, well, by, b-, -"
sd,"uh, i make my living by, uh, flying airplanes for,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, as a, as a, uh, an airline pilot i have to take random drug testing"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i mean it seems to me the public outcry was for that at the time, -"
sd,"so i when i finish a, a certain flight on a random basis i have to,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, and, and that's without i-, uh, probably cause,"
b,uh-huh
%,"and, uh, a-, -"
%," it isn't, -"
sd,"and they've found, uh, i think, uh, in pilots anyway, of something like, uh, uh, eighty-six thousand tests there's only been two guys have come up, uh, three guys have come up positive,"
sd,"and one of them was a bad test,"
%,so -
^2," positive for anything,"
%,see yeah
sd," see, uh, and i just started working, well for an electronics firm down here,"
sd,i used to be a reporter
b,yeah
sd,"and then now, i'm in corporate communications,"
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, part of that excuse me, was, as a new hire, that i had to take a drug test,"
b^m,"drug test,"
b,"righ-, -"
sd,and i had never been asked that
sd,"and i thought, um, i really didn't like it"
sd,"um, i, i have very mixed feelings about it"
aap_am,i don't disagree or agree with you
b,yeah
sv,"um, i think i-, i think that it's well"
sd,"and you're in that field,"
h,"so i don't know,"
%,"but it's, -"
sd,"you know, we lived in, uh, minneapolis when the northwest airlines pilot in the dakotas, -"
b,"yeah,"
b,right
b,"yeah,"
sd,"that hit the fan like, uh, -"
sv,"you, uh, you're obviously aware of that, um "
aa,"yes,"
aa,i am
sd,"i don't know there should be some happy medium in terms of, -"
sv,"if they're going to do random, um, -"
sv,"i, i don't agree with random, -"
b,yeah
sv,"um, i don't see a problem with that"
sv,"i do think, i see some level of necessity, um, in something where people are transporting other people, uh, only because of the things you've heard about"
%,the problem is -
sv,"the reason i feel that way, even to a low degree is because it's the old story the minority make it bad for the, you know, majority, um"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i, i can understand the public's alarm to it,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,i'm not alarmed
sd,"but, i guess, having done this all my life, i knew that there wasn't a problem"
sd,"and, and it, indeed it has proved out that way,"
oo_co_cc,"but now, try to get the damn thing repealed, you know"
ar,"you can't,"
%,"yeah,"
%,"i know, it's, um -"
sd,"i guess i feel bad because, -"
%,"uh, not only that -"
qh,"but in some of the instances like you just cited where you have to give your fingerprints, i mean wha-, what, what happens if you say no"
sv,if you say no then you're excluded
%,"and i, -"
sv,"doesn't seem the courts, -"
aa,"right,"
aa,"right,"
%,"it's a matter, -"
aa,"and that's, um, exactly what it is"
b,yeah
sv,"i mean, that, that kind of screening in general is a matter of exclusion"
sv,"um, if we didn't give it we wouldn't go to romania"
aa,that's right
%,"i mean, if, -"
sv,"you hate to say that,"
sv,but that's the way it is
sd,"it's my feeling also that, that, that although -"
sd,"i, i don't know if it's that serious, i-,"
sd,"but that was part of the question,"
b,"uh-huh,"
sv,"i do feel the courts have, have held up a great deal of, of our privacy, i mean particularly look in, in some of the, in some of the, -"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, i notice in some of the sexual cases they've held up a great deal of privacy,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but it i guess with our fear with crime and maybe airline crashes and things like that, it does seem that we've, we've slipped and that's eroded,"
sv,"or at least those in the market place their everyday life seemed to take that as a signal that, you know, it's fair game,"
%,"t-, -"
sv,"you, you have to answer these questions, of course"
b,uh-huh
h,"uh, i don't know,"
sv,"i, i feel there has been an erosion"
sd,"and i don't really know how serious it is, except i don't like it "
sd,"in terms of the privacy, yeah,"
%,"that in it, -"
sv,"and also, i agree with that"
sd,"and in the, in terms of the question, um, in terms, uh, -"
sd,"i worked in medical public relations for almost a decade,"
b,um
sd,"and that was pre-aids and all the other, um, things,"
b,um
sd,"and i have a real problem with medical professionals,"
sd,"um, it goes back to the things like drug screening"
sd,"but if it's in any level even with the potential to endangerment, -"
b,uh-huh
sv,"um, and i think this is much stronger than, you know, pilots or, uh, train engineers being screened,"
b,yeah
sd,"um, the transmission of the aids virus, um, -"
%,"i-, -"
%,"i-, -"
sv,that's a real ethical problem
sd,"i mean i don't, i don't have the answer,"
sd,"i, i, you know, i mean i think of the young girl in florida who, -"
%,"well, yeah"
%,"that's, -"
qy,was she from your part of the country?
qy," or was she from, -"
br, what was that? 
sd,"the young girl that, uh, contracted aids through her dentist, allegedly"
bk,"oh, yeah,"
bk,"yeah,"
bk,yeah
sd,"and then they proved it,"
%,yeah
b,right
sd,"i don't, i don't know, um, i-, y-, i don't know if it's the old story that we are killing ourselves in general, or what, um,"
%,"well i mean it, it, -"
sd,"just take that, that step now, where, where now we feel there's a need to do that"
sv,"and the next thing you know then,"
b,uh-huh
%,"tha-, -"
b,"oh, yeah,"
%,"the, -"
sd,"i guess the question is, uh, -"
qh,"the, the thing for me is, who sets the parameters or who has the control, you know"
b,"yeah,"
h,"i guess so,"
ba,"i mean well, uh, good luck to you,"
sd,you just moved to texas 
b,yeah
sv,"uh, i don't,"
b,yeah
sv,i think they'll be a cultural shock
sd,"i mean i was based there a lot, uh, several times in the service"
sd,"and i was absolutely flabbergasted at the, -"
sd,"in, in at least in criminal law some of the, some of the,"
%,"oh it's, it's ter-, -"
%,but -
%,"i'm, uh, -"
ba,"very seriously, -"
%,"no-, -"
sd,"more than just seriously, -"
sd,i'm more than likely going to be going to law school in the fall
bk,oh yeah
ny,"and, yeah,"
sd,if i figure out that's still what i really want to do -
sd,"and, th-, the things i'm finding out are the in terms of things like privacy, the way the law is interpreted, presented,"
b,yeah
sv,"um, it's no better than journalism "
sd,"um, this is very frightening in that, uh, oh, -"
sd,"and in, uh, in texas they, they d-, they do not require for instance for prospective adoptive parents,"
b,um
sd,they're one of only five states that do not require a criminal investigation check
sd,"yet, if you're caught with, -"
sv,"let's just say, um, that somebody who's in ne-, -"
%,"not us, -"
sd,"but somebody who's need of carting, um, aluminum beer cans around,"
sd,"they haven't touched them,"
sd,"they haven't drank them,"
sd,they picked them up off the street
sd,"and they want to take them to a recycling, uh, resource "
sd,"um, they've, they've been going through a lot of bad publicity here in the last three or four months again, um, because they've been arresting people like that"
sd,"well, i mean, i don't understand,"
qy,you know -
%,"if you, if you don't, -"
qh,"if they don't make a criminal check, why do you have to be fingerprinted"
sd,"because, um, in our case, one is at the state and the other one is at the federal level because you have to de-, because you have to deal with the i n,"
%,"yeah,"
sv,"because you have to deal with the, uh, imi-, immigration service -"
bk," oh, i see,"
bf,oh the state doesn't require it
qy,"well that's kind of, that's rather, that's rather unusual, isn't it "
ny,yeah
sd,"it is,"
%,"it's, uh, -"
sd,"the whole thing is, -"
sv,"i mean there's, again there's no consistency"
%,"you know, like in your, -"
sv,"in terms of you being a pilot and being tested randomly, um, i can't see why after a certain number of years or after a certain time frame they can't do it at an interval,"
qy,"or you know, i mean -"
x," ,"
qh,"well i guess, i guess the extension of that is, why, why not, -"
sv,"the next thing you know, we'll just stop a random amount of motorists"
sv,and then if we really think that drugs are a problem we can randomly stop anybody on the street
sd,"they, they do that in texas"
bh,"oh, they do?"
na," they don't do it for drugs,"
sd,"what they do is they check to see if you've got, uh, current insurance"
sd,"or they check to,"
b,yeah
sv,"well there's, there's all sorts of scare tactics, i guess, to, to invade our privacy"
%,"and, -"
b,"yeah,"
ba,i know
sd,"and it's kind of, um, -"
t1,"what's the word i want,"
%,"i don't, -"
%,"it's ju-, -"
sd,"to me it's just frightening, you know"
b,yeah
%,"i mean the old, uh, -"
sd,"i'm old enough now where george orwell, -"
sd,"uh, way past time -"
sd,"i just going to say, nineteen eighty-four,"
b,yeah
sv,but it's here
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"it's exactly true,"
%,"i mean i, -"
sv,"and the computers, of course helps that"
sd, the computer abilities store that information 
ad," well look at what we're talking now,"
%," i mean, it's, -"
ad,"look how we're talking now,"
qh,"i mean you wonder ultimately what a network of stranger, you know, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sv,"now then you heard the question,"
^q, what 
b, uh-huh 
sd,"well, i'll tell you, i used to do a lot more repairs when cars were easy to work on, than i do now"
b,okay
sd,"i do, uh, i do the easy stuff now"
sd,"i change oil,"
sd,"uh, and then what some people would consider a little more difficult, i, i'll change spark plugs"
sd,and 
%,um
%,well -
sd,"but, uh, i can't do as much as i used to,"
sd,"um, i used to do a whole lot more, but not any more,"
sd,they're just too weird to work on now
qy," is that the reason you're not doing it,"
qrr,or are you so busy you don't have time to do it?
sd,"well, that's part of it "
%,uh
aa," yeah,"
sd,"part of it is, like you said, i don't have time"
bk,okay
sd,"well being a female and being alone, you, i don't do anything but put gasoline,"
b,uh-huh
qy,"but, uh, have you had any major repairs recently?"
ng,"well, um, on this car i've got now, no,"
sd,"but i had a van before,"
sd,"and it was only two years old,"
sd,and it had transmission go out on it
b,oh
sd,but fortunately that was covered under the warranty
b,okay
sd,"well, you should be, feel very fortunate"
sd,i had to have a transmission replaced in an eighty-six automobile 
%,um
sd," and i'll declare, that's an expensive -"
aa,"oh, yeah"
aa,"yes,"
b,uh-huh

sd,"well, i have a very comfortable car "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh

sd,these people were recommended by a neighbor 
b,uh-huh
sd," and, you know, that's the only thing,"
sd,i am not a native of dallas
b,"oh, i see"
sd,"so that means i have to depend on, on trustworthy friends "
b,right
%, and that's -
sd,"anyway, it's fixed,"

sd,and i pray that i get my thirteen hundred dollars out of it
ba,"oh, gosh"
b,uh-huh

qy,are you there?
ny,"yes, sir,"
sd,i'm right here
bk,all right 
%,"okay, um,"
sd,"i'm in an area where, um, we can, uh, enjoy it year round,"
sd,"so, i've actually been, uh, uh, been out within the past couple of weeks"
sd,i'm mainly a freshwater fisherman
qo,how about yourself?
sd,"well, actually i've done both kinds "
b,uh-huh
sd," uh, i'm originally from the state of virginia "
b,uh-huh
qy,"did you ev-,"
ng,i don't believe i have fished the james river
sd,"there's a possibility, but that was so long ago "
b,uh-huh
sd," i moved here to, to state college, uh, in nineteen fifty-five "
b,uh-huh
sd, and that has pretty well limited my fishing to fresh water 
b,uh-huh
sd," and we have a lot of, uh, beautiful fresh water streams that come through thi-, this area"
sd,"i'm in an area called center county, which is in the very center of the state of pennsylvania,"
sd,i've i've been in that area
sd,and the trout fishing is supposed to be legendary
sd,"the trout fishing is really, uh, beautiful"
sd,"as i say, the, the streams are, oh, eight, ten, fifteen feet wide and so forth,"
sd,"and, uh, you, you stand on the edge and you, you cast out and you, you work, uh, from your feet most of the time "
b,"uh-huh,"
^2,for brookies -
sd," and then there are, there are a few lakes of course, close"
b,"yeah,"
qy,"what do you like, brookies or, uh, rainbows"
%,"or, -"
%,"i, -"
%,"wherever the area, -"
sd,"whatever the fish is the specialist in that area, i, uh, i enjoy fishing for it,"
sd,"and i try to, -"
sd,i haven't fished in several years 
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
qy,"do you fly fish, or are those streams too small?"
na,"uh, no,"
na,"we, we fly fish"
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sd," i used to do that a little when i lived up in new york,"
sd,but 
b,uh-huh
sv,"oh, that's a pretty big fish"
aa,"uh, yeah,"
%,"they're, they've, uh, -"
sd,"the striped bass have accommodated themselves to the big fresh water lakes,"
sd,"and they're pretty exciting when they're, when they're running"
b,uh-huh
sd,"it's a salt water fish in fresh water, uh, environment"
sd,"well, our, our streams here are replanted with fish about every year "
sd,it's all put and take
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and this is, of course, x number of weeks or months before fishing season opens"
%,"so, -"
qw,what's the season?
qy^d,"april to sep-, october or something like that?"
na,that sounds about right 
b,uh-huh
ny," uh-huh,"
sd,pretty close
%,uh 
%,you know -
qw, what's a license cost?
sd,"well, as i say, it's been several years,"
sd,"but the licenses weren't that expensive,"
%,"i, -"
sd,"seems to stick in my mind, five to seven dollars "
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sd,it's about the same as texas
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"and i have, oh, probably a half a dozen different kinds of, uh, fishing poles and, and fly rods and so forth,"
sd,"and, and i had been so busy in my work in these last few years that i haven't had time to fish"
sd,"but i'm going to be retiring at the end of december,"
sd,"and i, i hope, uh, the next fishing season, that i can sort of get back in and, uh, enjoy that"
sd,"that, that was a really enjoyable, uh, thing for me to do"
sd,"well, i have all sons, so i think i'm probably going to be fishing for a long time "
sd,"huh, i just have one son and he, he lives out of the state now, rather, in the eastern corner of it,"
sd,"so, i don't think he has time to fish either "
sd,"i caught the disease from my father,"
sd,and i'm passing it on to my children
sd,"it's really , -"
bh,"oh, is that right?"
sd,"they love it,"
ny,yeah
ba,"oh, my goodness"
b,right
sd,"well, i, i, the disease i caught was simply because, uh, i, i was in the norfolk portsmouth area,"
%,and 
b,uh-huh
sd,"there's, there's so much water around "
b,right
b,right
sd," and, uh, i fairly enjoyed at that time -"
sd,i have a small aluminum boat here 
b,uh-huh
sd,"when i go on one of the large lakes that we have here that i enjoy fishing for, for trout from that,"
sd,"uh, uh, i don't, i don't know about the lakes in central pennsylvania"
qy,are there many?
sd," well, as i say, i'm in center county"
no,"there's, um, there're two different size lakes about, well, five, six miles from state college"
b,uh-huh
sv,now these aren't huge lakes from your point of view 
b,uh-huh
sd," but they are probably fifteen, twenty acres maybe "
b,uh-huh
qw,"so, how is the weather out there?"
sd,"uh, it's really cold"
sd,and it's supposedly for this time of the year it's unseasonably cold
sd,and they've gotten more snow than they've ever had
bh,"oh, really?"
sd,"you have, breaking records for coldness and all that kind of stuff"
qw,how about you guys?
sd,"um uh, it's just, it's a, it's about same"
sd,"the usual, i think"
b,oh
sd,"so, nice for skiing and all that kind of stuff "
sd,it's good
b,"yeah,"
sd,"well the weather, let's see, well, the snow here is different from utah's,"
sd,because i have lived in utah for like ten years
bh,"oh, really?"
qw,what part?
%,"and, uh, -"
sd,provo
sd,i was going to b y u
bh,"oh, really?"
bk,okay
aa,yeah
sd,"and, uh, the snow is like, really cold"
sd,"i mean, it's, like, really humid"
sd,so it seems wetter or something like that
%,"it's, -"
qy,it's more humid in utah than there?
ny,uh-huh
qrr,or there?
sd,it's more humid in iowa 
bk,okay
aa,right
b,yeah
bk,okay
sd,"and it seems like when the winds blow, it's really, it goes right through you"
sd,it's really different from utah's weather
sd,"i thought utah was cold,"
sd,but i think iowa is a lot colder 
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"see, that's how it is in texas, too"
sd,"because when it's cold, it's really cold"
%,"so, -"
b,"yeah,"
sv,i don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind 
br,what's that?
sd,i don't think there is any mountains to stop the wind
b,right
b,yeah
sv,so the humidity is i think what does it 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,i think that's true
%,"because i, i noticed when i got here, too,"
%,"because like i'd, -"
sd,when it would snow in texas 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and we'd have to get really warm,"
sd,and here you can almost not even wear a coat outside when it's snowing
sd,and you don't 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sv,it was weird
b,yeah
qw,"but, so how long ago did you graduate?"
qrr,"or did you,"
%,"or, -"
sd,"uh, i graduated in nineteen eighty-seven"
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"my husband got his doctorate at b y u,"
%,"so that's, -"
sd,and so he just graduated this past year
b,oh
qy,so you just barely moved away?
ny,uh-huh 
ny,"yeah,"
qy,do you like it out there?
sd,we miss 
qy,you do?
b,yeah
sd,"because it's, like, really flat here "
sd,"well, not flat, but hilly"
sd,but no big mountains or anything
b,uh-huh
qy,so you just moved away a year ago?
na,"uh, in august"
ba,"wow, really recent"
aa, yeah
t1,"but, uh, see, see what else can i say about the weather"
sd,"uh, , well, today was warmer "
sd,it was like forty-five 
ba,"oh, warm "
qw,"so, what's the temperature up today over there?"
ba,"oh, man,"
sd,"it's got to be like, it's probably fifty, fifty-five, maybe"
bh,"oh, really?"
no,maybe not that warm
%,"probably about, uh, -"
%,yeah
sd,"it's not, it's not that cold, really"
sd,"and whenever i remembered the weather reports in utah, i never really remember them talking too much about wind chill"
b,yeah
sd,but they talk about wind chill here all the time
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"that's a big deal in texas, too"
sd,"they said it could be, like, six degrees out and, like, negative forty-one wind chill"
b,um
sd,"so, that's what we're not used to "
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sv,that makes a big difference huh
%,"so, oh, i, -"
qy,"so, did you used to ski when you were out here?"
br,what's that?
qy,did you used to ski when you were in utah?
no,"oh, i've only, i've only skied in utah once"
bh,"oh, really?"
sd,i only skied once my whole life 
qy,"but, do you do a lot of skiing there?"
ng,"uh, not tons,"
sd,but i like to when i get a chance
b,uh-huh
sd,"i've only been once so far, but had the opportunity a couple times since then"
sd,just saving my money for christmas things 
b,yeah
qy,so is this your first year in utah?
nn,"uh, no,"
sd,this is actually my third year
qy,and you're going to school there?
ny,uh-huh
b,oh
ny,yep
qy,"at u of u,"
%,"or, -"
nn,"no,"
sd,at b y u
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,yeah
b,oh
sd,"so, but, i'll be here a long time , at this rate"
qw,what's your major?
sd,"uh, it was nursing,"
sd,but i'm in the process of changing it right now
b,"uh-huh,"
b,oh
sd,"because it's really, really competitive at b y u"
b,yeah
sd,you have to have like a three seven to get in
%,"so,"
aa,that's true
sd,i'm going to look into some other fields
%,"i'd like, -"
sd,"all the science classes and that, i'm just not really enjoying too much"
sd,so 
b,uh-huh
%,"so, -"
b,"yeah,"
ba,"that's, that's a good idea"
qy,did you graduate in a certain field
qy,"or, -"
sd,"uh, education"
sd,i got a double major
qw,"in, -"
sd,"uh, elementary and special ed"
qy,really?
ny,uh-huh
sd,that what my sister did
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,"yeah,"
sv,you might know her
sd,"here name is lori, bird"
h,maybe not 
sd,"i think she graduated around then, too, though, eighty-seven probably,"
%,"but, she got her doc-, -"
b,"yeah,"
arp_nd,"well, i can't, -"
sd,"there are so many girls in all my classes,"
sd,i can't remember 
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"because they, since, uh, stopped that program i mean, where you can "
bh,"oh, have they?"
b,oh
sd,"i mean, it's, it's really, -"
sd," capital punishment, uh, i guess, out in california is, has had a lot of, uh, a lot of, you know, discourse in the paper"
sd,"uh, apparently, you know, there's, they haven't, uh, executed anybody since nineteen sixty-seven, i believe"
b," uh, yeah"
sd,"that's, that's as far back as i can remember "
sd," well, that's before "
b," yeah,"
%,"they, -"
sd,"well, i, we were, we, uh, we just started, we lived in redwood city when we were out there"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, and we found that, uh you know, it was a very liberal kind of community"
sv,"but the, uh, i, i really feel that, that the law enforcement community, uh, you know, puts these people behind bars"
sv,"and then they, they, uh, uh, you know, lawyers, these lawyer groups get together"
sv,"and they, uh, they, i think, extend beyond the normal, uh, appeal process uh, you know, and just drag these, this guy, uh, his, his, uh, ultimate, uh, demise out for ten or fifteen years"
sv,"uh, and i, i think that, uh, that there's something that has to be changed in the system to, to do that"
sv,"i think capital punishment, uh, uh, was or probably stringent enough"
sv,but i think the appeal process is really getting in the way
b, uh-huh
qy,"do, do you feel as though there should be, uh, more, uh, was or, or more, uh, you might say transgressions that would be enforceable by, uh, by, uh, uh, capital punishment?"
sv,"well i think that currently the way the law stands isn't so much that the laws are enforceable or not,"
sv,it's more they're not enforcing the death penalty itself
sv,"it's at that point where they're saying like here you're, you're going on death row"
^q,but you'll stay there for twenty years
b,uh-huh
sv,and nothing is being done about it
sv,"uh, the laws exist and are frequently upheld in, in, uh, in appeals court just because of technicalities and because of maybe small little holes that their defending attorney can find"
sv,"and it's, it's really getting out of hand in many states"
sv,"well, the term technicality -"
sv,"the law enforcement community,"
sv,"or whether, uh, an-, and whether the rights of that individual are been, have been, you know, impuned"
sv,"uh, but or whether there's just, you know, a policeman has just made a, uh, a, you know, a non, a noncritical error, though be it not the right way to do it -"
sv,"but, but, you know, the, the merits of the case in terms of, you know,"
h,"now, i, i'm, a-, a-, at this juncture"
sd,"i, you know, i'm, i'm not sure, you know, what constitutes a, a technicality"
sv,"you know, that, that's what all c-, these, these hearings are about"
sv,"and that's what all these, you know, court cases are about"
sd,"i mean our, uh, our, our glorious, uh, you know, mayor here in washington is six days away from getting out of, out of the can"
sd,"and, uh, you know, he, he tried to appeal his conviction uh,"
sd,"and, you know, it didn't work"
sv,"but be that as it may, everybody who got enough money will pump the appeal process dry"
sd,"uh, in, in the old days, you know, and say round about times of battle of hastings, you know, and the villages if you were a transgressor, they, they either, you know, drove you out in the woods or you became a ward of somebody"
sd,"and he, you were his slave"
sd,"and if he didn't like what you did, he killed you"
sv,"and that has, that's pretty effective"
sv,"uh, you know, it's not good for civil rights, i guess,"
sv,"but it's pretty effective in that, you know, you've got to get along in the community"
sv,"and if you don't you'll perish either by the hand of your, your, your master or by being pushed out in the woods"
sv,"so, i, i, i mean as, as man has gotten more complicated so all of the, uh, imaginations to, uh, you know, protect him from, from being, uh, dumped on by, uh, civilian authority in, in so-, in criminal actions, especially, you know, murder cases and that sort of thing"
sv,"well, it seems like , well it, it seems as if in the past typically there have been a lot of cases of people being wrongly tried or wrongly punished,"
sv,"and the whole idea behind the current criminal process system is to protect those who actually didn't the crimes, albeit it seems that we are failing in that, in that ultimate goal because there are times when people who are guilty are getting off"
sd,"um, for instance, um there's a case a few years back where, uh, someone, uh, someone who's being convicted for, was under a tri-, was going to trial for murder, was let off because of a technicality in that the of-, the arresting officer, uh, did not read the defendant their rights"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and where his,"
sv,"well, wayne, i, uh, feel very strongly about parents doing things with their children, and making time available even sometimes when time isn't available"
qo,how do you feel about it?
aa,"well, yeah,"
sv,i feel much the same way
sd,"i've, uh, two kids right now "
b,yeah
sd, one is two and a half
sd,"and one's nine months,"
sv,"and, uh, that age, of course, everything you do they're trying to learn to do,"
sv,"and so, uh, it's important for you to spend time doing the things that you want them to learn, you know, that, that they need to learn at the age, you know "
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd,"we went through this with our children, and now with our grandchildren,"
sd,"and i've always tried to do things with them, uh, like, when you're at the little league, helping out even though i'm not a good athlete myself,"
sd,"i was able to help the coach in, in just controlling the kids, if nothing else,"
sd,"and we've always, uh, oh tried to take our children and no-, now at this age our grandchildren to see and do things that otherwise they might not be able to"
sv,"i think that's just part of their overall educational process, is to get out and see and do things"
aa,"right,"
aa,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
%,"and so, it's uh, -"
sd,"we have, uh, lived several places around the u s"
sd,"and we have, where we've lived, we've taken them to see and do things of interest and of historical significance in the area,"
sd,"like when we lived in tennessee, we, we took them to washington, d c to see all the capitol and, and things like that when they were small"
sd,"and it's just, uh, it's helps, i think, the children to, when they're learning in school, to say, well, i've been there and i've seen that"
b,right
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
%,"so, uh, that's the type, -"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"it certainly does, because, uh, you know, the things in the books seem so dead to the kids, you know, unless they've actually been there or whatever,"
sd,"because i remember our family, well, we, we, we went everywhere"
sd,"and, uh, seeing new england and, uh, being on plymouth rock and stuff like that was "
b,yeah
b,yes
sd,"and we could, uh, read the things in the history books and understand what they said, when it was like, we need food, we need to raise food quickly "
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd,"we've, uh,"
sd,"i remember my parents didn't do all those type things,"
sd,and so i made a special effort with my children to do things like that
sd,"and even now with my grandchildren, i feel it's a very important thing to be done"
aa,"right,"
sv,"because if, uh, kids don't look up to you, or, or, ca-, can't feel they can spend time with you, they're going to find someone else "
b,yeah
sv," and uh, you know, nowadays there's a lot of people out there that you don't want your kid to, emulating or whatever"
b,yeah
sd,"well, i can remember one of the things i'm most proud of is, uh, when my son was, -"
sd,"i think it was in the sixth grade,"
sd,"they had to write a, a little brief autobiography of themselves, and about what they had done and what they wanted to do,"
sd,"and i was very proud when my son wrote that he wanted to, uh, have a family and be able to help coach little league and do things like his dad had done with him"
sd,a real point of pride with me
b,"yeah,"
aa,that is nice
b,yeah 
sv,"excuse me, it sounds like we both have colds"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"well, it's, um, well, it's, uh, ten o'clock here in falls church, virginia"
b,oh
sd,so that the only reason i'm home is because i'm home with a cold 
%,"oh, well, we're -"
sd,"and the wife says, well, you need something to do,"
^q,talk to a guy on the phone
b,"yeah,"
sd,"well, i'm sitting here on the ninth floor of an office building on the north side of dallas, texas"
sd,"so, we're kind of far apart here"
b,yeah 
sd,"this is a very interesting program i, i heard about here on this,"
sd,"and when i signed up for it, it, uh, looked like it could be, make a real contribution in participating"
aa,right
aa,"yeah,"
sd,i'm an electrical engineer by trade 
b,yeah
sd,"likewise, we, uh, we do some projects every now and then"
sd,"we like to get support from, uh, other, other companies as well"
b,yeah
sd,i'm an accountant presently working as a contractor liquidating a failed savings and loan 
sd,"so, trying to work myself out of a job "
sd,"but, it's been an interesting, uh, roughly, oh, nine months here,"
sd,"and, uh "
b,oh
sd,"we've lived here about seventeen years,"
%,"and it's, uh, -"
sd,we enjoy living here
sd,"it's where we originally started out,"
sd,and we've lived up north for a while in chicago and over in tennessee
sd,"so, wound up back about two hundred miles aware, away from where we started out"
b,yep 
sd,"well, uh, that's about all i can think to talk about right now"
fc,it's been a pleasure talking with you
fc,okay
ft,thank you
bd,right
fc,bye
fc,bye-bye
qw,"so, jan, how do they recycle in texas?"
%,"well, i, -"
sd,"the biggest, uh, way it's going right now, uh, lot, most of the grocery stores "
b,uh-huh
sd,and then they've just got different barrels setting out -
sd," , i shouldn't say barrels, like big john doors or,"
b, uh-huh 
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"um, they've got them set outside "
%,"and, -"
qy," is it, "
b," uh, "
ny,yes
sd,it's all voluntary
sd,"now, they do have some places where you can take things and get cash"
b, right 
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, they just want to, uh, help recycle which is,"
b, yeah 
b,uh-huh
%,"we, -"
sd,"probably the only thing, sometimes we'll take cash or the cans in"
sd,and we let the kids get the money for that
b,right
b,yeah
%,"but, uh, -"
sd," there's, "
%," f-, -"
b,right
b,right
aa,yeah
aa,"that's true,"
sd,"but, but that's really the, the biggest thing around here is the grocery stores participating"
b,uh-huh
%,"you know but, -"
%,"i guess, i, -"
sd,"you see, i guess it depends on your landfill space"
b,uh-huh
%,"i know, i, -"
sd,"we're in maryland,"
%,"but, my, -"
sd,i from pennsylvania *missing copula?
sd,"and my parents how, are forced recycling,"
bh," oh, "
b," uh, "
b,yeah
ba,"oh, wow"
sv,"uh, pennsylvania, ohio, and new york are some of the, uh, -"
sv,they're using their landfills up faster than they can get new ones
b,yeah
sv,"so, it's really, uh, it's, uh, really hard on them"
sd,"now, up here in maryland, though, we're j-, just in a voluntary recycling stage right now"
sd,"so, uh, so my wife and i, you know, we save our bottles,"
sd,"and we save our newspapers,"
sd,"and we save all our plastic, and all of our tin cans"
sd,"and just like you say, we go to, uh, a community area where they have it set up"
sd,and we dump them off there
qy^d,"so, it's vol-, -"
ny, yeah
sd,"it's still voluntary, "
sd, you say it is all voluntary
qy,"do they, -"
qy,will it be mandatory?
b,uh-huh
qy,"is it all, um, -"
qy,is there any place at all where you do get cash for this stuff
qrr,"or is it all, -"
sd,mostly just the cans
bk,okay
%,"and i, -"
b, yeah
%,"and that's, -"
sv," and most of the time, like i said, that's, that's a sort of like fund raiser things that,"
b,right
b,right
b, yeah 
aa, yeah
aa, that's true
%,"that's, -"
sv,cans are the only thing i think you really get money for
ar,"well, they do have places around here where you can get money for your newspapers,"
b, uh-huh 
sv,"but, you know, i think a lot of people, like i said, are more concerned,"
b,right
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sv," i think that's mostly, -"
%,"well, you know, we, -"
%,"even before, -"
sd,"as soon as the community said, you know, we're going to put up bins for recycling, you know, we automatically started,"
sv,"it was,"
b,right
sd,"you know, and just going and taking the time to go and read the signs and the brochures on what they accept and how it should be,"
b,uh-huh
%,"that's, -"
sd,"well, i tell you, it's kind of funny now at, e-, even at t i, i don't, -"
qy,do you work for t i?
nn,no
nn,huh-uh
bk,okay
sd,"um, at t i they're doing recycling"
sd,"i mean, for a long time they didn't do this,"
sd,"but now they're, they're recycling cans and paper"
sd,we have separate bins 
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
%,"you know, and they, -"
sd,i mean it's tremendous how much money they have saved and even saving all these trees
sd,"and, you know "
b,right
sd, i can't believe that 
b,yeah
^2," how much, how well they're doing "
%,yeah 
%,"we do, -"
sd,"i, um, i, i work in a, uh, speech interface lab,"
b," oh, okay "
sd,and we do basically the same thing
sd,"the state of maryland has lost, asked all the colleges and universities, and some of the large organizations, you know, if they would definitely recycle their office paper"
b,uh-huh
b, uh-huh 
sd,"but, you know, in the giant bins around, -"
sv,and it's surprising how much 
b,yeah
b, right 
b,yep
sv," you don't notice until, "
sd,"you know, they don't pick up your recycling until it's full"
b,right
ba,i know 
sv,"reams of paper come,"
sv,"well, you think about,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i mean, you know, cost wise and "
b,right
sd,"i mean, it's just amazing, you know,"
b, yeah
sv,"so, i think, "
qy,"you know, i guess a lot of the large organizations, probably t i, did they advertise on television how successful they are?"
nn,"n-, -"
sd,"i haven't seen,"
b,yeah
sv,"uh, but that doesn't mean that they don't"
sd,"i don't watch much t v,"
b,yeah
sd,"but, i haven't really seen anything advertise publicly"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and then, like i said, they do a lot of internal, "
b^m, internal 
b, uh-huh 
sd," but, i haven't seen anything"
b,yeah
sd,"but see, i don't see a lot of t i advertisements on t v anyway"
sv,"i think they advertise more, um, other places where they're not located"
aa,right
aa,yeah
aa,"that would probably,"
sd," you know so, "
b,yeah
sd,"because i know that some of the large industries here will advertise on television,"
sd,"you know, they'll jus-, come up and say, -"
sd,"you know, they'll show you tho-, to encourage , to encourage recycling"
sd,"they'll,"
b, right 
^q,"and here, those of us that dumavra power, which is our power company,"
b,uh-huh
^q,"we now recycle forty-five percent of our solid waste,"
b,right 
%,"and they, -"
%,"and that, -"
^q,"we do this for the community,"
sv,they put those on
sv,"so i, so i think, you know, we're probably reaching a successful stage and, and just with voluntary,"
b,right
sv,"well, even, i mean, in the kid's schools,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, i know my kids, um, like if they see litter on the ground they pick it up and say, oh, look at that somebody is not saving the earth, you know"
b,right
b,yeah
sv,"so, i mean, the kids, i mean, they really try to educate all ages, you know,"
sv,"and it's good to start the kids real young on,"
aa," i think so, too "
b,yeah
sv,"i mean, it's like nobody was concerned about it"
aa,right
aa,yeah
sv,"we weren't,"
sd," you know, and it's like, -"
aa,yeah
aa,that's true 
sd,"you know, it's like all of a sudden when there's noticeable things, saying, hey, you know,"
b, huh 
sv,"you know and now everybody is doing something about, which is good"
b,uh-huh
qw," but how come we weren't doing this, say, twenty years ago ,"
b, yeah 
sv,"i, i think really probably what hit peoples, you know, i know that here in the, up in the, uh, uh, the, the new englands area and also in, in pennsylvania, ohio, and new york, the, just run, all of a sudden we're out of landfill"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, and they're saying, we estimate this landfill be ov-, will be full in two years unless we cut back"
b, uh-huh 
sv,"so, i think that, that became, -"
sv,"that all of a sudden really hit home that there's no longer landfill space,"
%,"this is, -"
%,"so, what, -"
%,"you know, and n-, no other state, -"
sd,i'm sure texas probably still has some landfill space
sv,"they're not going to voluntarily say, hey, ship your garbage here"
b,right 
aa, yeah
aa,that's true 
sd,"it's really,"
sv,"i think,"
sd,"i mean, this is such a tremendous,"
b,uh-huh
%,"i mean, why, -"
qh, i can't understand why nobody saw that before
sd,"i mean, even, even not "
b,uh-huh
sd,"i,"
b, right 
b,yeah
%,"but, well, -"
sv,"well, in some ways, i guess, it, it doesn't become really cost saving until you have an industry around it, you know because,"
sd,"but, the de-inking process that they have to, they use,"
b, uh-huh 
b,uh-huh
b, oh 
sd," and also, it w-, it produces a, a waste, a, um, a,"
b,oh
b, okay 
^2,is not 
b," oh, okay,"
b,"okay oh, "
%,yeah 
sd,"i,"
sd,"so,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"they,"
b,right
^2,and glass
b,right
%,yeah
b,uh-huh
%,"so, i-, -"
sv,it really is surprising that people haven't noticed it before
aa,yeah
aa,that's true
b, uh-huh
%,yeah 
%," and even, -"
sd," i, i noticed that a lot of gas stations are telling you to recycle your oil"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, i mean, that kind of surprises me "
sd,"i mean, you know, because once oil gets so, you know, thick and yucky, you'd wonder how they could, you know, clean that up,"
b, yeah 
sd,but they can
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, i don't know how cost efficient that would be, i guess,"
b,yeah
h,"i d-, i don't know either"
%,"that's, -"
sd,"i know that though, i, e-, all those petroleum products though are so terrible for your, um, the water table"
b, uh-huh 
sd," you know, they really pollute quickly"
%,"and, you know, one, -"
b,uh-huh
ba, wow 
sv,"so, it's one of those things that they really, -"
b,yeah
aa,yeah
ba,i know 
b,"yeah,"
qh,how terrible that is
sv,"so, we'll have to, we'll have to keep our eyes on all that, i guess"
b,really
b,uh-huh
%,"i know i really, -"
h,"i don't know,"
sv,"i, i think that, i mean, i think that they really are doing a good thing now"
sv,"and i hope it keeps, -"
sv,"well, i'm sure we'll keep up"
aa,yeah
aa,"i,"
qy," you know, "
sv,i think it's really catching on
b,uh-huh
%,"you know, i, i think that, -"
%,"i'm not sure if it, -"
h,"i don't know,"
sv,i think it's a good idea to make it mandatory 
aa,"i do, too"
%,"um, it, -"
sd,"because like we were asking some people that live in, um, north dakota, well, are you saving your, you know, are you recycling"
sd,"and they said, well, we're not forced to do it yet,"
sv,so no
b,uh-huh
h,"you know, so, i mean i don't know,"
sv,"i think that if people are forced, if the people are not forced to do it they may not, you,"
b, yeah
h,"i mean, i don't know,"
sv,"i think a lot of people still will,"
sd,"you know, i know that it's really funny"
sd,my parents are forced to do it
%,"and they, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay <<very faintly>> um,"
qw,where do you live?
sd,in plano
qy^d,in plano?
ny,yes
qw,where do you live?
sd,in dallas
bk,"oh, okay "
sd,"uh, the air pollution isn't too bad in our area"
sd,"so, we're very fortunate "
b,huh <<very faintly>>
sd," um, i was trying to think, uh, -"
sd,something we were watching the other day -
sd,"and they were doing an overview of los angeles, uh, from an area that was up higher"
sd,and you literally could see the band of smog
%,"that, uh, -"
sd,"i've never been out there,"
sd,"but,"
sd,i haven't either
b,uh-huh
%,"and, -"
sv,"well, i think it would be terrible to live in an area like that"
sv,"and, unfortunately, i think there are a lot of areas that are, that, that bad"
b,yeah
sv,"particularly in the areas where there are industries, uh, where they are burning a lot of coal,"
b, yes 
b,yeah <<very faint>>
sv,"i think it's a bigger problem with the car pollution, anti-pollution devices,"
sv,"i think, uh, air isn't as bad it once was, from the cars, because we certainly have plenty of cars in our area"
b,yes
sd,"well, i know, uh, that's been the concern in europe"
%,"they hadn't, -"
sd,"uh, we have friends in germany and, uh, have family that live near the black forest area"
sd,"and large areas of the forest are being hurt from the cars because when we, s-, uh, switched to the unleaded gas and, and had the emission control advice, uh, , devices required on the cars, uh,"
sd,that's something that europe didn't do right away
sd,and now they're doing that
sd,"and i guess it started in the last few years because they have found that in that particular part of the country, that's the only pollution that's been there"
sd,it's not an area that is industry
sd,"but they were losing a lot of, uh, trees and a lot of, -"
qy^d, from acid rain?
na,"um, i guess from, from something that the car was, uh, was giving, "
sd," i think it gives off, uh, in the emissions, it gives off gases which combine up in the atmosphere, uh, and form a, a weak acid"
b," yes,"
%,"and, -"
sd, it just makes the rain fall on the acid side
sd,"and after a period of time, i think that accumulates in, uh, trees because they take it up through their roots, as well as it landing on the leaves, on surfaces,"
sd,like you've seen what it's done to buildings even 
b,yes
b,yeah
sd," what's interesting, several years ago, i took a course, uh, on, uh, well, -"
sd,"it was actually, it was put on by the power companies and, about the various sources of energy and how much pollution there was,"
sd,"and there wasn't from various kinds of, of energy -"
sd,"and, uh, at that point in time, one person that was a speaker brought up the topic of acid rain"
sd,"and it was kind of pooh-poohed, you know"
sd,"oh, you're making a mountain out of a molehill, kind of thing"
sd,"and it's turned out that, that's been very true, what he was forecasting about the accumulation of, of the pollutants in the air and the acid rain and what it would do to foliage"
sd,"so, it's kind of interesting the change in perspective from when i took that course"
sd,"now, a lot of people are really afraid of nuclear"
sd,"uh, i'm not afraid of nuclear, having had that course because of how the nuclear that, uh, they use is not bomb quality,"
sd,"and, we're so strict with all our controls in the united states the chances of, of an accident are slight,"
sd,"and, it doesn't pollute the air at all "
sd,it's safer to be around a nuclear plant then it is to be around a coal plant
sd,many more deaths have occurred in and dealing with coal plants then ever around nuclear plants
sd,"it's kind of funny because people are just petrified, at least some are, at the thought of nuclear"
b,yes
h,"so, i don't know"
sd,in europe there's a lot of dependency on nuclear power
sd,and they recycle the fuel
%,"and then instead of, of, -"
sd,"some people are really afraid to recycle the fuel because they're afraid it could become, uh, bomb quality "
sv,"but, that's the only sensible thing to do, is recycle and reuse the fuel and not store it down in the ground as far as i'm concerned, where it could eventually, perhaps, there's some problem, uh, pollute the groundwater"
h,"so, i don't know what the answer is"
sv,"the best answer, of course, would be solar or, uh, fusion, or something clean "
b,yes
qy,"well, we've got a problem on the line, don't we"
ny,yeah
sd,"i, i get that sometimes, um,"
sd,my line gets some static
sd,i don't know why 
b, uh-huh 
sv,"but, uh, solar, of course, would be the clean, the cleanest"
%,"well, i know it's , um, -"
sd,we did have a solar water heater when we lived in houston
sv,"and, uh, oddly enough i thought our part of the country was ideal"
sd,i can't hear you at all for all this static 
sd," oh i don't know what to, -"
sd,usually it's the other phone i have trouble with
sd,"it must just,"
qy,can you hear me?
sd,now i can again
b,okay
sd,"i don't know what, uh, i, i don't know what the problem is"
sd,"but, uh, when we lived in houston we had a solar water heater"
sd, and 
sd,"and we have enough clouds that, uh, there are other areas that would be better suited"
sd,"that surprised me because i think,"
b,uh-huh
%,"and, and it, -"
b,"yes,"
sd,it can be used
sd,and it can help
sd,"but, uh, that was a problem that they were still working on"
%,"but, -"
b,oh yeah
sv,"it, it's still got a long way to go"
%," well i, -"
sv," it's just, you know, a possible solution "
b,yes
sd,it may not in all ways
sd,"maybe they'll come up with fusion you know, con-, be able to control it"
sd,"i don't know how long that'll take,"
sv,"but, one of these days, -"
sv,because that's perfectly clean
b,yes
sd,it's just we can't control it
sd,"right now it takes more energy to cause fusion to occur then you get out,"
%,"so, it isn't, not at all, -"
sd,"and you can't control it unless you gotten a huge electromagnetic field,"
sd,so that's not going to work at least not now
sv,"but, uh, who knows what the future will hold uh, as far as energy goes,"
sv,"i, i think, with solving some of the energy, future energy problems, we'll probably solve some of the pollution problems as well"
ba,"uh, i hope so "
sd,i do to
sd," i like to be optimistic,"
sd,i don't like to be pessimistic about these things
%,"well, i do think, um, -"
sv,"i mean, you've already mentioned several things, i think, uh, just the change in attitude and the fact that more people are aware there is a problem and more people are interested in, uh, -"
sv,"we have one earth,"
b,yes <<very faint>>
sv,and we got to take care of it
b,yes
sv," well, "
b, uh-huh 
sd,"i've noticed students are, are much more, you know, young, young people are much more receptive to ideas about the environment "
b, yes 
sv,"and so, if we can raise it, uh, you know, generations with those concerns, we'll solve a lot of our problems"
%,"i'm afraid, -"
sd,"i know i was part of the me generation where they didn't, so many of them didn't, people didn't care"
%,"you know,"
%,"it's whatever, you know, -"
^q,"recycle, well, if it's a problem, forget that"
^q,"uh, not throw the trash out the car window"
^q,and leave it in the car and then throw it away?
sv,"how horrible, you know"
sd,"now, i've always done those kinds of things because i just didn't like messes,"
%,and <<voices fade off>> -
sv,"so, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the state of pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order"
sd,"and after the fact, the state of pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it"
qo,what do you think?
qy,is pennsylvania kind of out of line there?
ng,"well, actually, i don't think they're out of line"
h,"de-, devil's advocate possibly,"
sv,"but it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes"
sd,"and whe-, whether or not you agree with that law, i-, you're still circumventing it"
sd,"you are legal in, in your circumvention of that law"
qw,"what, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though?"
qw,"i mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order?"
sv,"really, i, i, i don't think that's a valid argument"
sv,i think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax
sd,"um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local k-mart or, or, uh, bryn mawr stereo dealer"
qh,"uh, but th-, th-, th-, then why not pay, pay the sales tax "
sd,"corporations have to,"
qh,"why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax?"
sv,"well, i mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when i purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the state of pennsylvania"
sd,"it's because, i'm sorry, the commonwealth of pennsylvania -"
b, yes 
sv,"uh, it's because i, i can't find the item that i want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area"
sd,so i go outside the area for that
sv,"and i think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state"
sv,"i don't, i don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer"
aa," i, i'll agree it, it's not your responsibility"
qh,"but, b-, is it also legal,"
sd,"w-, w-, fr-, from what i understand from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years"
sd,"it is, it is a lost revenue stream right now"
sv,"and states c-, can use all the revenue they can get"
qy,"with some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply?"
no,"well, i think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then i don't argue with it"
sv,"because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, i bought this out of state"
^q,i need to xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to pennsylvania
sd,which is exactly what businesses do at the present
aa,right
sv,but the point is is that businesses do that
sd,the business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question
sv,that's a cost of doing business
sv,the burden 
sd," and i, i "
%,uh
sd,"that's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works"
sd,"usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay"
sd,"but the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay"
sd,"and there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that"
qy,"uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and "
%," i-, -"
nn,no
sd,"businesses, uh "
sd,"if, if i'm a computer consulting firm and i see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say utah"
sd,"um, i, i might buy the mother boards from utah but then still have to pay pennsylvania sales tax"
sd,"my a-, accounting department will at the end of the month"
sv,"i think that i-, i-, i think that's the way things work in pennsylvania"
sd,"and i know they work that way in, uh, say here in d c"
b,yeah
sd,"see i'm unfamiliar with that because i don't, i never see that end of the business"
b,yeah
sd,"so, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer"
sv,"uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then i think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided"
aa,that's true
sv,"i-, i-, a r-, a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, i, i forgot that"
sd,"there, there is no well defined mechanism at all"
sv,"and, and that it is a a l-, loss i, i think is that the federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju-, just to do just that in or-, in order to gain the revenue that's being lost"
sd,"uh, i mean, i, i don't know if i agree with that"
%,"but it, but, -"
fp,hi
qw,"so, uh, what was the last car repair you had?"
sd," just recently i was kind of laughing when i, when i heard the switchboard talking about the question because, uh, i had to have my, uh, radiator flushed "
bk,oh
sd, and it was getting rusty
sd,"and the thing that they forgot to do was to, um, to also look at the hose,"
sd,"and i had gone about oh, two days with my new radiator flushed"
sd,and the hose burst
sd,so i was stranded out on the highway 
ba,"oh, no"
qy,did you crack the block or what?
nn,"no,"
sd,"i, i didn't do that thank goodness,"
sd,"but, uh, there seemed to be enough antifreeze in there, you know, left to do that"
sd,"but it cost me all kind of money, you know, to have that repaired after they said they were going to, they had repaired it"
sd,"so that was, that was a horrible experience "
bk,"yeah,"
bk,i see
sv,you got lucky you didn't ruin the whole engine though
aa,"yes,"
aa,yes
sv,that can be pretty serious
aa,i know
aa,i know
qo,what about you?
sd,"oh, i guess it's been awhile for me"
%,"i'd sa-, -"
sd,it's been about a year
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i had the, uh, the water pump break on my car"
bk,oh
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i was traveling, uh,"
sd,i was going on my way home from thanksgiving 
b,uh-huh
sd, and it broke like in the middle of nowhere
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, i had to get it towed and then fixed"
%,and -
b,uh-huh
sv, big pain -
aa,"oh, oh, i know i know"
sv,especially when you're out on the highway
aa,"yeah,"
sd,that's where i was
sd,luckily someone came by and gave me a ride
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"i know, well, you know, uh, living in dallas, -"
sv,"you know we've got, uh, bumper to bumper eight lanes of traffic"
sd,"and, uh, that was, that was horrible"
b,yeah 
%,"you know to have the, you know, -"
sd,your car is fuming -
sd,and everything
sd,it's already a hundred degrees
sd,you don't need that too
ba,"oh, shoot "
sd,but my car is getting old
sd,"see it's about six years old now,"
%,so -
b,"yeah,"
sd,so is mine 
b,"yeah,"
sd,so i got it right out of college
sd,"and so it's, uh, it's starting to show the wear and tear now"
b,"yeah,"
sd,i'm hoping mine gets me through
sd,i got until may until i'm out
sd, so when i cross that one i'll be okay
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sd,"that, uh, that was my graduation present to myself,"
%,so -
ba,"oh, that's nice "
aa,yeah
aa,"yeah,"
aa,i know
sd,"so but gosh, it's really starting to, to wear"
sd,"so i've been thinking, especially now is a good time to buy a car"
b,yeah
%,"go-, -"
sd,"because i can't, uh, i don't know if i want to, you know, pay all these repairs now to start getting it fixed when it's starting to breakdown"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,i don't want to do too much on mine because it will be worth more than the car is
sv,and it's not worth it 
aa,"uh-huh,"
aa,uh-huh
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
aa,i agree with you there
b,yeah
h,"so i don't know, uh,"
sd,"because i, i need to have it tuned, you know, tuned up and i don't know, replace some of the belts"
sd,"and i was looking at the, uh, -"
sd,tires need to be replaced
sd,and so i was thinking just a lot of money -
%,"i'm, -"
sd,might as well buy me a new car for that
aa,"yeah,"
sd,i got new tires last winter too
sd,"so i'm like, well, that's the last major purchase for this thing"
^q,it's not worth it
aa,uh-huh
qy^d,"well, you have to, in pennsylvania, boy,"
qy," you have to really have your car winterized and stuff, huh?"
ny,yeah
b,uh-huh 
ny,"yeah,"
sd,we get some killer winters up here in the mountains
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,yeah
bk,"oh, okay"
%,"so, -"
sv,lot of snow and a lot of cold
b,uh-huh
qy,"well, especially don't you have what, a lot of salt on the ground?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,at times there's a lot of it
b,uh-huh
sd,you got to like clean out the underneath of your car all the time when you get a chance
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
qy,"well, rust and the, and the body too, huh? -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i haven't had a big problem with that though
b,uh-huh
sd,so i've been pretty lucky there
sd," well, i think they get the new z-bart stuff and everything to where you can, um, -"
aa,"yeah,"
ba,that's usually pretty good
sd,you just rinse it off after the winter is over and 
b,uh-huh
aa,"yeah,"
%,and go like that so -
b,yeah
sd,i usually like to do most repairs on my own though
bh,do you?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,just because that way i know what's wrong with my car and what it needs and what it really doesn't
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"plus if something goes wrong, i know who to blame"
sd,"well, i, i think i'm getting too old for all that"
sd,"my, uh, i had four brothers"
sd,"and they used to drag me out underneath the car, and stuff"
sd,"so i can, i can do all that stuff"
sd,"but i, i think i'd much prefer to pay the twenty-two ninety-five to, to go have it done now"

qy,"well, uh, do you, uh, do you ever use the a t m machines?"

sd,"so i, you know, i, just, if i need cash, i just tell him"
sd,and he gets it out
sd,and i don't even think i know my number

sd,"see we, he couldn't do without it, h-, but, you know, since he can just do it right there at work,"
^2," oh, that helps "
b,right
b,yeah
sv,"well the, the other thing some people are not aware of, is they will use their a, their credit card like their visa or their mastercard for cash "
b,uh-huh
sv," and when they do that, they begin paying interest right from that very day on"
aa,you're right
sv,and that's kind of silly

sv,"well, it's interesting, uh, that, uh,"
b,yeah

b,yeah
sv,"and, then, some people they get so wrapped up in them that they find, you know, one day they find, wow, i didn't realize i had this much,"
^2,that much stuff
b,right
sv,"and, then they can't meet the minimum monthly payments on it"
sv,"well, and some people use one credit card to pay for another credit card they own,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, i mean, that does nothing, but exacerbate the entire problem"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"it does because you're, you know, you, you're, you know, you're just co-, costing yourself more money because you, if you can't make the monthly, the minimum payment, you're paying interest,"

qy,are you a native of that part of the country?

sd,"i live on one of tho-, that little ten mile spot"
ba,"uh, sounds wonderful"
qy,did you have damage this year with hurricanes?
ng,"not up, um, where i live"
sd,but further down the coast in massachusetts they got hit pretty bad
sd,i happened to be in nassau
sd,and we got the backlash of that thing
sd,"and they had record high waves, thirty year high waves come in there,"
sd,and it was quite an experience
%,so -
qw,"well, what movies are you looking forward to seeing now?"
^h,"um, well, i'm, i'm only twenty-seven years old"

sd,so i would recommend that if you have a chance
sd,i'm in for it
sd,we rent a lot of movies
sd,"so we, we often sit around and say, what movies should we rent?"
sd,and we don't know 
ad," well if you, if you can get green card, go for it"
aa,"all right,"
sd,we'll try that one
sd,"i have been working at, uh, as an accountant at the medical school here in dallas"
sd,"and i have watched, uh, gross anatomy"
qy,have you seen that one?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i did
bk,okay

bk,"oh, okay,"
bf,he works for t i
nn,"no,"
nn,"no,"
sd,"but his wife has a contract with t i,"
sd,"and that's how we learned about it,"
%,uh-huh
bk,"oh, okay,"
sd,because i'm down at n c state
b,"yeah,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so i took a class,"
sd,"and he said, sign up and get some money "
ba,right 
qy, so are you ready?
na,i'm ready
%,"okay,"
ad,let's get started <<sounds like a phone beeping in>>
aa,"all right,"
aa,okay
%,"okay,"
qo,"so, uh, what do you think, that, uh, -"
qo,"what do, what do, what do you think we can do to solve the crime in america?"
sv,"oh, if i knew that i'd be a very wealthy person"
b,"yeah,"
qo,"but what, what, what are the steps?"
sv,"well, you have to see,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","i, the way i look at it, you have to think first of all why, *listen"
qh,"or ha-, has crime increased,"
qh,"and if so, why has crime increased?"
sv,"well, see the problem is, is that, um, what happens is as, that you're, uh, you know, as you go from the country to a city, crime always increases, right?"
b,uh-huh
sv,"because in the country, people still respect, uh, the property of other people"
b,right
%,"and so, as, as, -"
sv,and the people in the country don't want as much as the people in the city
b,uh-huh
sv,"now what happens is all those that don't have any money in the country move to the cities,"
sv,and they rush to get the same thing
sv,"they say, why can't we have the same things that these other people have,"
sv,"and the thing that we can do is, we need money for drugs,"
sv,"and what we have to do is, we have to go, uh, get some stuff, steal it, and then, you know, just resell it"
bf,"it's easy,"
sv,you said the magic word there
qw, which one? 
sd, drugs 
b,yeah
sv,and that certainly is one reason why crime here has increased
sv,"that's, uh, that's, uh, the main reason i think, uh, everywhere"
sv,"because, uh, you have deaths"
sv,"i mean, i mean, you have murders"
sv,"and you have, you know, people stealing other people's stuff,"
%,and that's -
sv,a lot of it has to do with drugs
aa,"oh, yes"
%,"it doesn't have to do, -"
sv,"i mean, the thing is is that, you know, it's like you might be standing somewhere, right,"
sv,"and like let's say you, you're, you're, you know, you're driving out"
sv,and you're driving back home
sv,and it's late at night
sv,"and you stop by one of these, you know, twenty-four hour, you know, gas stations joints"
b,yeah
sv,"and, uh, somebody walks in there with a gun"
sv,"i mean, they're going to want the money,"
sv,"and you can tell by the people who are always caught, that these people are there to get money for drugs"
sv,"i mean, they don't want the money so, uh, so they can do something else with it"
aa,"no,"
sv,"they don't want the money for food,"
sv,that's for sure
aa,"right,"
aa,"right, "
%,and so -
sv," well, but you know, the, the strange thing, uh, perhaps, not strange, but something that many people don't realize, is that you can go back as far as nineteen fifty-one and fifty-two and find that there were drug dealers at that time trying to influence the high school kids,"
sd,"because, uh, i'm a retired educator"
bk,okay 
sd,"and, in fifty-one and fifty-two, the police came to the high school where i was and were telling us how to recognize when kids were on drugs, how to recognize the pushers "
b,yeah
sv,"so it's a problem that's been around for over forty years,"
sv,"and we're just really, uh, uh, now, trying to, uh, figure out how to cope with the problem because it has grown so huge"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"there's a, there's a, uh, a song that i know which says, you know, tha-, -"
sd,"it's like, in, uh, nineteen eighty-eight, nineteen eighty-nine, the local, state, and federal governments spent the least amount of money on crime in america,"
sv,"and, uh, their figures, i think are too, so -"
sv,"i mean it's like, compared to, you know, compared to, weapons or stuff like that, i mean, you're spending nothing on, on crime in the country itself"
%,"what you're doing is, you, you know, -"
sv,"it's like, you have other things, you know,"
sv,you have the aids
sv,"we're going to solve, try to solve "
b,uh-huh
%,and then -
b,yeah
sv,"and another one of the problems is that the people who are the dealers, the big dealers in drugs,"
b,uh-huh
sv,but those people never get caught
%,the people that 
aa,"that's right,"
sv,they'll never get caught
sv,"see, their theory is that if i'm surrounded, and i'm going to be caught, i'm going to try to find my way through,"
sv,and they're not going to take me alive
b,uh-huh
sv,"but i have such a big army outside of my place, that nobody can touch me"
aa,that's right
%,"but they'll, -"
sv,"you know, it's like, -"
sv,"of course, i mean i might be, you know, the the leading drug dealer here,"
sv,"but you won't find me dealing in drugs,"
sv,"i mean, there's no connection "
aa,that's right
aa,"that's right,"
%,"and, they, -"
sv,one person doesn't know the other person down the line
aa,right
sv,"but the guy at the very top, the one who's, who's really making the millions and the millions is the one who also many times is part of the power structure, uh, the, uh, and had the political "
b,yeah
sv,because it sure is monstrous in this country
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i was, i was at a, at a party on saturday,"
sd,"and this guy comes over,"
sd,"he goes, hey, how you doing, "
sd,"he started talking to me,"
sd,"and this guy was from jamaica, right"
b,uh-huh
sd,and he's got his little brother selling drugs <<voices in background>>
b,uh-huh
sd,"you know, and he goes, yeah, i just came up here to work,"
sd,"and i go, oh you did, you make very good money up here"
sd,"he goes, yeah, i make a lot, a lot of money,"
%,"he goes, you know"
%,"and, uh, in the movie good fellows -"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,might *spelling??
qy,did you see it?
nn,"nope,"
sd,i only heard about it
bk,"okay,"
sd,"in one part, the guy goes out of jail,"
sd,"and within, uh, two months, he has all his house payments gone "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and he had enough money to, you know, -"
sd,"it's like, those guys, at one point, you know, they had so much money that they didn't know what to do with it "
b,"yeah,"
%,"really, you know,"
sv,"even in our prison systems they're finding that they're, they're having drugs smuggled into them"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"that's, that, that was also in the movie"
b,right
b,yeah

qw^d,"i'm not sure what the difference in light years between the new generation and the, the old guys was"
sd,i think it's a hundred years

ba,imagine that
b,"yeah,"
ba,that's amazing
qy,"but, did they have some pretty good special effects?"
na," oh, excellent, excellent special effects"
sv,"but i think the script was, you know, just incredible compared to the last one"

qh,"well, you know why?"
nn,"no,"
sd,i don't
qw,why?
sd,"uh, william shatner wrote it"
bh,"oh, is that right?"
sd,"and even worse, he directed it"
b,"uh,"
sv,"l-, leonard, s-, nimoy, he does a lot better"
aa,"oh, yeah,"
sd,"he, in fact, uh, he didn't direct this one"
sd,he produced this one 
sd,"but he directed the one before, uh, i think star trek four, something like that"
sd,"in search of spock, or, no, journey home, i think that was"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,uh-huh
qy,"are, you're a real life trekkie?"

b,"oh, yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
%,"i, -"
sd,"it's, it's kind of funny"
sd,"i, uh, was reading in, uh, a book uh, trying to think, -"
sd,"i can't quite remember the name of the book,"
sd,"but it was, it was saying don't do star trek management style"
sd,"and they were referring to, you know, captain kirk,"
sd,"every time he left the enterprise, everything went to hell"
b,oh
sd, and nothing got righted until he got back up on the ship 
b,"right,"
qy^d,"so he kind of was a cowboy type, too"

sd,"uh, i like seafood"
^h,"uh, let's see,"
sd,"uh, shrimp, steamed she-, uh, shellfish with maybe herbs"
sd,"uh, spicy lobster with lem-, linguini"
sv,that sounds good
b,yeah
br,"now what is, uh, what is, uh, the steamed shellfish you said?"
ny,uh-huh
qy,"and what would that be like, a clam or, uh, -"
na,right
bk,okay
b,yeah
sv,"uh, i think hors d'oeuvres are good, too"
sd,"uh, and that way, you can have a variety uh,"
qw,"so if you have a, a dinner party and you're going to serve, uh, seafood for supper, what type of, uh, hors d'oeuvres would you serve prior to the meal?"
%," uh,"
qrr,"like cheeses or fruits or vegetables or, -"
b,"yeah,"
sv,fresh vegetables would be good
%,"or, uh, just, -"
qy,"probably not nachos and dip, huh?"
nn,no
qy," and would you, uh, would it be appropriate to, uh, drink with the, uh, prior, when you have the hors d'oeuvres?"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,yeah
bk,okay
qw,"and then when you serve the meal, what type of wine would you have with, uh, with the, with seafood?"
^h,"oh, all these hard questions "
qy,"uh, what, white wine?"
na,that would be my guess
b,yeah
sd,"and,"
sd,"i'm not really a drinker,"
sd,"so i'm not, i don't know a lot about that"
qy^d,something sweet?
ba,"oh, goodness"
sd,"uh, chocolate, something chocolate"
%,"uh ,"
qy^d,you must like chocolate
ny,yes
^h," well, let's see"
sd,"usually when we have a dinner party, i always, i like to grill"
qy^d,"oh, you do?"
sd,"so, we might have some cocktails ahead of time and maybe some, uh, some dip, uh, some cheese"
sd,"one of our favorites is, uh, to take some, let's see philadelphia cream cheese i think, is that what comes in "
b, uh-huh 
b,yeah
sd,and then you just dip the cracker in the sauce with the clams and the cream cheese
sv,and you have a real nice dip that goes good with a cocktail
sd,"and then i like to barbecue, like steaks or pork chops"
sd,"and then we have, uh, s-, oh, lot of times we'll have baked potatoes with them "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and then, uh, i don't know what we usually have for dessert"
sd,"cake sometimes,"
sd,"but, uh, that's what we would do for a dinner party, i guess"
sv,"that sounds good, too"
sv,"but that's, i guess when you talk about dinner party, that's probably not, uh, that's more for like when friends come "
sd,traditional 
^g, right?
sd,"traditional,"
ny,yeah
b,yeah
sv,"i wouldn't be the big, uh, snotty kind"
sd,"i just started,"
sd,"and i bought a martha stewart,"
qy^d,i don't know if you've heard of her
nn,huh-uh
sd,her cookbook
sd,"and she talks about catering and, uh, you know, goes into, goes into all that and the different types of, uh, uh, different types of parties, you know, different types of foods"
qy,"oh, well, do you work in a, uh, in a setting where you, uh, are in the food business?"
sd,"um, my father owns a restaurant"
qy,"oh, in, uh,"
sd,"it's, it's just a, uh, c-, a cafe,"
sd,"so it's not really anything, you know, that i want to, -"
sd,it's not the same 
sd,"uh, it's in lewisville"
bk,"okay,"
bk,all right
qw,so you graduated from which high school?
sd,trinity
b^m,"trinity,"
bk,okay
qy,and that's a public school or private?
sd,that's public
bk,"huh, okay,"
sd,"i have to get to know this area a little better, i guess"
qy,"uh, well, is your father's cafe, uh, one that you could cater out of?"
nn,"no,"
nn,"uh-huh, *listen; mistranscription of 'uh-uh'?"
sd,it's not
qy^d,"um, and he's not interested in letting his twenty-one year old daughter experiment with it probably"
%,uh
^h,"well, let's see,"
^h,"what else for catering uh,"
t1,"let's see,"
qw,what about hawaiian luau
sv,"oh, that would be good"
sd,"could have, uh, uh, fruits and, and pineapple, uh,"
^h,"let's see, uh,"
sv,"and you could actually go with, uh, a chicken if you wanted to"
sv,"i think, i think decorating your food is, you know, really, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
qw,so what kind of luck you been having with buying and returning products?
sd,"uh, not too bad really"
sd,"uh, i had a razor that i got from christmas that i just, i really didn't want it,"
sd,but i got it anyway
sd,"and, uh, it was a braun"
sd,and they were real good about taking it back
sd,"it wasn't a problem at all,"
sd,"so, uh, i was able to get that back pretty easily"
b,uh-huh
h,"but, uh, i don't know,"
sd,i really haven't returned a whole lot lately
qy,have you?
ng,i haven't had to
%,"it's, uh, the, -"
%,"every so often, -"
sd,"i mean, i, i, i'm almost pushing it myself"
sd,maybe i'll buy a shirt from g i joe's
sd,and it shrinks too much
sd,"and say, well, i should have known better,"
sd,"i mean, i bought it from g i joe's "
b,um
sv, and it was probably made in china by slaves
b,right 
%,"but, uh, they, uh, -"
sd,"most of the time pretty careful shopping anyway, i get pretty good stuff"
b,yeah
sv,"i think that, uh, aside from the fact all markets being internationalized "
aa,right
%,"like, -"
sv," and if you want to buy american , it takes real extra work to find"
aa,exactly
sv,it's probably 
%,"i was reading, -"
aa,"right,"
sd,"i was reading something in, uh, consumer reports tonight about that as a matter of fact"
sd,"they were talking about cars, uh, the car issue just came out"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, you know, the transmission may be made in japan or whatever"
b,yeah
sd,"uh, like i've got an eighty-six ford ranger"
sd,"and, and i know for a fact that the transmission is made by mitsubishi"
b,huh
qh,"you know, so it's like, what are you going to do, you know?"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,really
sv,"but, uh, that's the way it is"
h,"i don't know,"
sv,"i, i personally feel that, uh, uh, if the japanese cars are better and americans buy them, you know, that's the way it goes"
sv,"and, you know, people, man-, more than manufacturers should get a clue"
sv,"and, you know, they should start making quality products"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,i think they're beginning to
sv,"the, the days of don't buy a car made on a monday or a friday are pretty much going away"
%,"and, -"
sd,"that's what i thought, too, until i saw the consumer reports issue"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, they've got all the american, well, all the, all the cars rated, you know,"
sv,"and, uh, essentially, i h-, i don't see much of a trend"
sv,"i mean, just like every other time that you look at it, the honda accords and the civics are right up there"
sv,"there's nothing wrong with them uh, and the same thing with most of the other japanese cars"
sv,but then again you look at a ford or especially a chevy
sv,and they're pieces of junk
aa,i know
aa,"still at it, hey"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"that's ninety, that's eighty-six through ninety-one"
ba,wow
h,"but, uh, i don't know,"
sv,"may-, maybe they're getting better,"
sv,"maybe they're starting to get a clue uh,"
sd,"well, they got a three year lead time"
sv,it probably won't start really showing up until ninety-four or so 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's just it
sv,"technology that comes in right now is, is probably not going to be imple-, implemented until, you know, quite a few years down the road"
%,"but, uh, -"
sv,the computer industry's where it's really dynamic especially for the consumer
aa,"oh, yeah"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"because technology is so, uh, you know, volatile and changing all the time"
qh,and can you 
b,"uh,"
sv,"if the product is upgraded and a better version is put out, you'll get a free version in the mail s-, -"
b,yeah
sv,"or, uh, maybe i say, well, you know, you paid five hundred bucks for this program, so send us twenty and we'll give you a really great upgrade"
b, yeah
%,"it, -"
sv,"uh, th-, they keep up c-, with it pretty quickly"
sv,"and that's, that's a real good thing, i guess"
b,yeah
h,"uh, i don't know"
sv,"and the hardware, well, i mean, all the chips that make up the hardware are a commodity"
sv,and the macintosh is about the only one that's going right 
b,yeah
aa,"right,"
sv,"they're kind of the leaders right now, you know"
sd,"i used to see all those commercials for windows, you know,"
sv,"and you're like,"
aa,"really,"
qh,"why don't they just say, almost a mac for half the price"
b,"yeah, you know"
sv,they'd sell more if they were honest
aa,"exactly,"
sv,"almost is the key word, there, too, you know, because i, i really, i've used both"
sv,and i really don't see an advantage of windows at all
sv,"yeah, it "
b,"uh,"
aa,"yeah, yeah that's true, too"
h,"but, uh, i don't know,"
sd,"i'm really, i've gotten a little bit out of the, the personal computer business just because i don't have one at home"
sd,"i, i do use a mac at work"
sd,"but, uh "
b,uh-huh
%,"but, uh, -"
sv,"apple's sort of making a s-, -"
sv, and they're ones were -
sv,"growling consumer, uh, need to worry about the mac they're getting, -"
sd,"like if you bought a power book straight off, a lot of them had to go back"
sd,they issued a recall because of improper shielding or possibly other problems with

aa,uh-huh
aa,"yeah,"
qy^d,"you sound like you must, uh, work in the computer business"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i have one,"
sd,i do desktop publishing at work
sd,and i have a machine at home
sd,and i belong to the user's group
sd,"and i, i've been a mac fanatic since they came out"
bh,yeah?
%,all right
sd,"but, uh, technically, i'm not actually in the industry"
sd,i don't work a computer company
bh,no?
sd,i'm an abuser
ba,"well, that's, that's all right"
sv,but it's sort of like surfing on the wave of future shock to 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sv,"something that i find uncomfortable is, you know, you, you want to buy something, say you want to buy a personal computer"
sv,"and you got to think about what kind of memory you want to get and what kind of technology that you want to go for, you know,"
sd,"let, let's take the example, the modem for, you know, -"
b,yeah
b,"okay,"
qh,"w-, w-, what baud rate do you get?"
sd,"well, you know, it used to be that you get a twelve hundred ba-, -"
sv, an interesting topic
aa,yes
sd,"the, uh, type of cars that i was, uh, i would be most interested in if i was going to buy another car now would probably be something like a, uh, mazda miata"
b,uh-huh
%,"uh, the, uh, -"
sd,"i'm very much a, a fan of sports cars"
ba,ah

sd,"but if i was to buy one, probably something like a miata"
%,"it's certainly, -"
%,"i-, -"
sd,i wouldn't have to worry about it breaking down all the time 
bh,"oh, really"
ny,yeah
%,"what's the, -"
qw,how old is your car?
sd,"uh, well i have a, i have a nineteen eighty, uh, eighty-five c r x"
b,oh
sd,"uh, which is, you know, it's, -"
sd,it still works fine 
b, yeah
b,right 
sd,"but it's, it's actually, it's kind of annoying cause i've got no reason to replace it "
b, oh 
%,"but, uh,"
b,yeah
qw,so what do the miatas run?
sd,"they're about, uh, uh, thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars and, you know, a bit more if you add some some options and so on"
%,but 
sv," well, that's not too bad"
aa,"uh, yeah,"
sv,that's a pretty good price 
sd,and 
b, yeah 
bh,really?
sd,i've never driven one
sd,"uh, uh, it's, it's, it's nice"
%,"they're, -"
sd,i've been down to a dealer and driven them
sd,"and i've also driven one at a, something mazda put on where, uh, they went to, uh, autocross events across the country uh, which is where you race in, uh, you race on, in a parking lot or something like that with a bunch of, uh, cones to see who can get through the fastest"
br,huh?
sd,"uh, you know, about a minute or so"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and oh, it handles so nicely"
qy^d,and so you've done this?
ny,yeah
b,oh
bk,okay
b,yeah
b, oh

sd,"it, it's just so smooth "

bh, really?
%,yeah
x,<<very faint>> 
aa,yeah
sv,nice car
qw,what are you interested in?
sd, whatever my husband buys 
b, yeah
qy^d,"you you don't get involved in, uh, car decisions? "
ng," oh, not too much "
nn,no
sd,"we, uh, we just got rid of a full conversion van that, that i, i, i-, that wasn't me"
sd,that was my husband
sd,he wanted a van
sd,"and he wanted to drive that van and travel and wanted everything in there t v, you know, the whole bit"
sd,but i never drove it
sd,"so it just, it wasn't me, you know"
b,yeah
ba,i can understand
sd," and then, "
b,yeah
sv, they're nice 
sd, because i'm with the kids all the time
aa,"oh, yeah"
sv, that's 
b, yeah 
b, yeah
%,"and, -"
%," it's not, -"
sv," it, it's small enough that it's easy to drive"
aa,yeah
sd, you pick up 
sv, holds a lot 
sd,and the whole parking lot's full of minivans
b,yeah
sd,"but, you know, i, i drive a little subaru"
b,yeah
sd," and, uh, we, i love that"
%,"i, -"
sd,we were going to trade that in for the van
sd,but i just wanted to hold on to it cause i just really enjoy that
b,right
sd,"and, uh, that's really all i needed was for something just to go here and there and back "
b, yeah
sv, minivans are nice
sd,i have a friend who has a minivan
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, i've driven it a few times"
sd,"and, uh, i-, it's nice,"
sd,it's nice
sd,"of course, you know, my fam-, my family has always had cars like that uh, in that, you know, my father's had a, had a, always had a v w bus every since, uh "
b,"oh, really "
b,"oh, really"
%,"uh, uh, -"
%,"they, well, -"
sd,"he, he used it, "
sd,"he often has to transport < > plants or, uh, things "
b, yeah 
%,or -
b,yeah
sv,it's amazing what a minivan can do
sd,we went camping this past weekend with some friends that had a minivan
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
qy,the pop-up trailer?
ny,uh-huh
%,"and, uh, it's, -"
sv,"so it's really amazing how much a minivan c-, you know, what it can do"
aa,yeah
sv,and they're not that expensive
aa,"no,"
sv,they're not
b,yeah
%,they're probably -
sv," mainly because everyone makes them, you know "
b,yeah
sv,you can take your choice of how expensive you want it to be
aa,yeah
sd,"and we, we do a lot of, uh, driving"
sd,we do a lot of traveling
b,uh-huh
x,<<very faint>>
sd,"and so that's the only time that the, that the, uh, conversion van came in handy"
sd,"but it really didn't cause our, our kids are still little"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, uh, that was the only time we really needed it"
sd,"other than that, it got terrible mileage"
%,and -
b,yeah
b, yeah
sv,"minivans d-, do pretty well"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,some of them probably even do thirty
b,yeah
%,"the, uh, -"
%,yeah
sd,"there, there's some other cars i'd like"
sd,"but i, u-, u-, i would never be willing to send quite that much money for, uh, like, uh, uh, -"
sd,i'll drool over them
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc", <<piano in background>> okay
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
sv,i guess we're set
b,"um,"
sd,current events
sd,"i get my current events basically from news, uh, just because i watch,"
^2, television news? 
qy,"is it, uh, c n n or headline news or just local,"
b," uh, "
%,"or, -"
sd,i watch a little bit of everything
sd,"i like to tune into, to c n n because, uh, you know, you can tune in like any time of day and pretty much get the update on,"
b, right 
b, right 
sv,"i think news today, um, it's kind of losing its importance"
sd,"like on, in, on radio, if you hear any news at all, it's like two seconds"
b,right
sd,"you know, really quickly,"
%," well, -"
sd,"on commercial radio, i guess, i, i tend to get more of my news from national public radio of the morning on the way to work,"
b," yeah,"
ba,"that's good, too,"
b,uh-huh 
sd,"so,"
sd,i like k r l d
b,uh-huh
sd,but i do here
b,"yeah,"
qw,where do you go to school?
sd,"uh, university of texas at dallas"
bk,"oh, okay"
sd,i went to u t at austin
b,right
sd,"but, uh, i'm a news reporter"
sd,"so i, i should get all i can , my news from the new-, from the t v"
b,really
%,"but, um, -"
sd,"i do tend to throw on headline news when i'm doing things around the house and just let it play,"
b," yeah, "
%,"but, uh, -"
sd,"i usually don't intentionally although i should, i don't intentionally turn on the television to watch news"
b,right
sd,or i don't intentionally turn on the radio to listen to the news
sd,"if it comes on, i just happen to hear it"
sd,"now, i will intentionally buy a newspaper to wa-, to, <<piano in background>> to look at the news"
%,"but other, -"
b," yeah,"
sd, all i ever get out of the paper is a sunday paper
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sd, that's about it 
sd," that's about it,"
%, yeah
sd,"the sunday paper, it's so full of stuff,"
sv,"but you pick your favorite section,"
sv,"and the rest,"
b, right 
b,right
sd,"although you paid, what, almost two dollars now to get it"
%,"but, -"
sd,"i like to listen to, uh, national public radio on the way to work because it's, i don't know, it's variety,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,it 
b,yeah
qy,"is it, is it pretty good coverage on there?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,it usually is
sd,"they throw in a lot of, you know, a lot of interviews and commentaries"
sv,it's kind of like getting a newspaper
sd,there's a lot of 
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,and 
b,um
sd,"because i find like on k r l d, -"
sd,"i like to listen to that,"
sd,"but each story is like no more than two or three lines, you know"
sd,"oh, well they spend a little more time, you know,"
sd,"they cover the headlines,"
b, yeah 
sd, and then they go into a lot of the issues and 
b,uh-huh
b," yeah,"
sd,that would probably be better 
%,"and it's, -"
sv,"especially when you look for the, like, popular radio stations like mostly the music stations, news is, is pretty much nonexistent"
b,yeah
sv,"they have little, little, teeny-weeny news,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"and only in the morning, i guess, there's a little bit"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,basically
sd,i haven't listened to a top forty radio station in so long i wouldn't know
b,yeah
%,"so, -"
^h,"so let's see, um,"
sd,"and i guess i get some kinds of other, you know, business related news through trade journals and things"
%,"but, -"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh,"
b,right 
b,"yeah,"
%," but, um, -"
sv, a lot of people are
b,"yeah,"
sv, trying to get out of wherever they are
sv,"but, um, i think, i think news is, -"
sd,i'm wondering where it's going
%,"you know how, -"
sv,"i think it will be nonex-, pretty much nonexistent except maybe through the paper"
sd,i know the newspaper used to be kind of the only source for news
sv,"and now, it's, it's kind of your final choice"
sv,"you watch, -"
sv,"first you go to c n n, then you go to radio or something like that"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"where nobody wants,"
%," and i think it, -"
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"it's, it takes a lot more time to read something,"
b, yeah 
sd," and you've got news,"
sv, so much more effort 
b, yeah 
sd," you know you,"
b, yeah 
sv,but i think that soon the paper may be kind of the only source again
qw,why is that?
%,"i don't, -"
sv,"well, just because i'm, i'm thinking that it, it's getting so short on radio"
sd,"you still, you have two or three, -"
sd,"i know in dallas you can probably get two, two all news radio stations out of i don't how many popular radio stations"
sd,"and then on television, you have just the news at six and ten"
b,"yeah,"
%,"i just, -"
sv,"and i just, i just see that dwindling in, in, -"
sv,"i find it hard to believe that people will go back to reading over television, i mean, just given the way society is"
sd,"and i enjoy reading,"
sv,but most 
aa,"true,"
aa,yeah
aa, true
aa,"that's true, too,"
aa,yeah 
^2,than sit down and take the effort to read 
aa,right
sv,"and they don't have to go get one, you know"
sv,"one thing i like about the paper, um, as opposed <<piano in background>> to television is that, uh, when i, like when i report, because i'm in television, i have to get the basic, the main facts and that's it"
sv,that's all you have time for
b,right
b,right
sv,"whereas in the paper, i like to read the articles because they get every side, every single side,"
b,right
sd,"well, that's why i like, uh, national public radio "
b,uh-huh
sd,"they give you headlines that are brief,"
%,"just, -"
sd,they touch on what's going on
sd,and then they'll get into something and really explore it
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and it's, it's informative"
sv,"it's a lot more informative than, you know, quick, half hour news shows that "
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd,because that's what we do
sd,"i mean it's like each story is thirty seconds, you know"
b,right
sd,so it's like you really have to tell as much as you can which is not much in that amount of time
sv,"so, and it will probably get shorter and shorter as the years go by i think"
h,i don't know
b,"yeah,"
sd,there's so much going on in the world
b,uh-huh
sv,"communication, you know, expands the world now"
b,"oh, yeah"
sv,there's too much going on
sv,you can't afford to give more than a couple of seconds here and there
sv,"i think that is one good thing, one great thing, about news,"
sd,"and we saw it during the war just now, is that we got all the information within minutes, you know"
b,yeah
sd,"whatever happened, we knew about it about the same time that they knew about it"
qh,"and the question is, how much of it or how, some of it, -"
sv,"i guess, there's a lot of debate about censorship and "
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
qh,"is it, is it the true story"
qrr,or is it a 
b,yeah
sv,"because even though we do get the story right away, they were censored as to what they "
b,right
qh,"so all we had to sit here and, and ask is well, what aren't they telling us, you know"
sd,"so that, that was pretty scary"
%,"but we, -"
sd,"i talked to one woman,"
sd,"and she said that she didn't want to know what was going on because if she had a son over in saudi arabia, she wouldn't want to know, you know, that they're bombing or, or this and that's going on"
sd,"and at the same time, i talked to another woman,"
sd,and she was so happy to know because she lived through vietnam
sd,and she didn't know what was happening at that time
b,right
sd,"and she was so happy to get the information, you know"
sd,so there's just a lot of different opinions on that
%,"but, -"
sd,"i, i, you know, i like to, to know what's going on"
sv,sometimes i think there's just a little bit too much
b,yeah
sv,"you know you get in the habit of, like i say, turn on headline news"
sd,"and it will play over and over ,"
sv,and you just tune it out because it's the same thing
%,"but, -"
sv,"and then, too, a lot of times i think, uh, especially on television they blow things completely out of proportion"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"they tend to,"
%," like, -"
sd,"you know, like this kennedy thing"
b,yeah
sv," <<sounds like a keyboard>> it's just, i mean, everywhere you turn"
sd,"kennedy,"
sd,"kennedy,"
sd,kennedy
sd,"you know, what kind of shoes did he wear on the night?"
sd,"and you know, it's just like, okay, this is ridiculous "
qh, like who cares?
b, really
%,"so, -"
%,"well, -"
qw,but what are you doing?
qy,sitting on a computer?
ny,yeah

fc,okay 
fc,okay
fc,take care 
fc, take care
fc,bye-bye
fc,"uh-huh,"
fc,bye
ad,"well, tell me about your home"
aa,okay
sd,"uh, right now we're living in, -"
sd,"well it's me, my wife and, uh, two young boys"
sd,"and, uh, right now we're in a, uh, i guess it's either a zero lot line or a garden home"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so we don't have a, a big yard uh,"
sd,"but, uh, when my wife and i first moved in, it was just the two of us"
sd,so it was enough
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, and it's, uh, i guess what they call a story and a half"
sd,because it's not a full two story
b,yeah
sd,"so, it's got real high ceilings on half the house"
sd,and the other half is just standard sized ceilings
b,huh
sd,"and, uh, it's about a five year old house now"
ba,it sounds nice
aa,"it's, uh, pretty nice"
sd,"unfortunately, the builder who built it went out of business already "
bh,"oh, yeah?"
ny,yeah
%,"it was a, -"
sd,landmark is the one who built it
b,yeah
sv,"well, you know, these guys that gambled high "
b,yeah
aa,that's true
sd,"and, uh "
aa,exactly what happened to them
sd,i'm building my own house
ba,"oh, that's nice"
sd,"and as i look out the window of my trailer, i can envision all the insulation that's going up today "
bh,"oh, really"
ny,yeah
qy,are you doing it yourself?
ny,yeah
ba,wow
sd,i used to be a builder
ba,"oh, that's nice"
sd,and i retired about five years ago and 
b," oh, i see"
b,huh
sd,and now i'm a college educated builder 
sv,"there's still no work, you know "
b, yeah 
sd," so, uh, you know, i decided this summer that, uh, you know, we had enough credit on the credit cards to buy the materials"
sd,so i did
ba,that's great
sd,"and, uh, see the, the, the state has a law that says you cannot borrow the money to build your own home"
%,"r-, -"
bh,is that so?
sd, i didn't know that 
sd, you can borrow the money to pay somebody else to build your house
sd,but you can't borrow the money to build your own
ba,well that sounds kind of dumb
sd," well, it's to protect the, the banks from guys that say yeah i want to build my own house and go out a build a spec home "
b,uh-huh
sd, and then it doesn't sell
sd,and then the bank's 
b, yeah 
b,yeah
%,well -
b,huh
sv,"as, as you know, anything that involves the government is, works half as well as it's supposed to costs three times as much right? "
aa, that's right 
sv,hence the savings and loan problem we have
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sd,"but, uh, you know, my home is, uh, fairly simple"
sd,it's designed to be added on to
b,uh-huh
ba,that's good
b,yeah
sd,"well, i figure it's just me and my wife"
sd,"but, you know, i like to do stuff with my hands and whatnot,"
sd,so i want 
b, yeah 
qw,how big a lot do you got it on?
sd,ten acres
ba,wow
ba,that's nice
ba,that's real nice
aa,"well, yeah"
sd,it's really nice too because i can't see my nearest neighbor
sd,he's on the other side of a hill
b,oh
sd,and my second nearest neighbor is a dot on the horizon
sd,seriously
ba,god
ba,that's pretty good
sd,"well, in the winter time, i can see, see another guy"
%,"but, you know, he's -"
b,uh-huh
sd," i can just make out his place, you know"
b,yeah
b,yeah
%,"and, uh, -"
ba,"oh, that's pretty good"
aa,yeah
sd,"well, i took a lot of time in choosing this site "
b,uh-huh
qy,"oh, you, you, you don't plan on putting any, any of that in?"
arp_nd,"well, it's got a, a very small furnace"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and a, uh, we'll use a wood burning stove as well"
b,yeah
sd,"but, in the house itself, i've been working inside, you know, these, lo-, these many months "
b,uh-huh
sd, and i have not had to use the heat
ba,wow
sd,because it's all geothermal
b,yeah
ba,that's pretty good
%,"and with all the, -"
%,"see i've got, -"
sd,on the south side is all glass
sd,"well, as much as i could get in it, you know"
b,yeah
sd,"i've got one, two, three, four, five, <<very faint>> six windows in the east side on forty-eight feet"
sd,so it's almost all glass
ba,wow
%,"and, uh, -"
sd, my wife would love that 
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,"i mean, you know "
sd, she loves lots of windows
ba, that's great
%,"so, uh, -"
qy,is it a single story?
arp_nd,"well, not really"
sd,"it's, uh, it's on the side of a hill"
bk,"oh, i see"
%,"so the first, you know, -"
%,"the, the, the, -"
sd,what i call residential level 
b,uh-huh
bk,"um, i see"
sd,"and the side that's on the, uh, the other side is about six feet high"
bk,oh
sv,so i've got a pretty good grade there
b,yeah
sd,"and then when i put the verandas whi-, which will be twelve feet out all the way around on the north, south and east sides "
b,uh-huh
b," yeah,"
qy,"that's kind of like, like a victorian style?"
na,exactly
b,yeah
sd,"i, i've always liked that"
%,"the, -"
sd,"you know, i, we don't have much yard"
sd,but i built a small deck in the back
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, you know, i, i see these magazines where, you know, dig your, your own deck"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i, i kind of wish i had them, those size property and, and, uh, one with a grade on it so i can build a real nice deck"
qo,so how's your products been?
sd,"um, i really haven't had, uh, too many problems"
sd,"uh, seems to me that everything that i buy goes bad just after the warranty runs out"
ba, i hear that one
qy,have you had any lately go out?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i've had a dryer, an ice maker, a microwave, all three,"
%,"and they, -"
sd,"unfortunately i bought them all three at the same time, when i bought my new house,"
sd,"and, uh, i really don't have any recourse,"
sd,so i had to call and have them all repaired and that
ba,"oh, wow"
b,"yeah,"
sd,it was a hassle
qy^d,"so you didn't get anything,"
qy,"even, all the, all the warranties were out?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"the warranty on the refrigerator, uh, -"
%,"the i-, -"
sd,"the refrigerator warranty's still good,"
sd,"but the ice maker itself, passed its three years,"
sd,and it was three years and two months
ba, you're kidding
nn,no
b,"yeah,"
sd,"we just moved into a new house, too,"
sd,"so we had to buy all those, too"
ad,"uh, watch out"
aa," yeah,"
sd,"the only thing i've had problems with is, um, -"
sd,i buy a lot of wood working equipment through the mail 
b,uh-huh
sd," and i bought this paint stripper where they advertise that it's nontoxic and such,"
sd,and when you get the product it ends up being toxic and all these warnings
%,so -
%,um
sd,"i didn't return it because it'd probably cost me more than, -"
sd,i just ended up using it
sd,"but, that's about the only thing i've had gone wrong"
%,but -
sd,"i usually have pretty good luck with appliances,"
%,"but i just, uh, -"
sd,"it was within two days that all three of these stopped working,"
sd,and the 
ba,that's incredible
sd,"and the, uh, microwave had to have, uh, some kind of something i can't even pronounce,"
%,"and they, uh, -"
sd,"the dryer had to have a new heating element,"
sd,"so it was about, almost three hundred dollars for all three of them"
qy^d,and they all went out at the same time?
na,"uh, within two days of each other "
b^m, or two days
ba, wow
%,"i was, -"
sd,it wasn't a good week
sd,i was pretty mad
sd,"and plus the place that i'd bought them all had gone out of business,"
sd,"so even if i, i think even if i had, uh, had kept the warranty, the service agreements were with the companies that, that manufactured,"
sd,"but still they were through that retailer,"
sd,so i don't know if i could have taken it to another retailer or not
ba,"wow,"
sd,it's frustrating
sd,"but i didn't have to worry about all that, because they weren't under warranty"
sd,so it was a call to the local appliance dealer 
b,uh-huh
%,"but, i, -"
sd,"the only other things that i've ever had trouble with, uh, -"
sd,"i seem to have a real bad trouble with electric hair dryers, blow dryers"
b,"uh-huh,"
qy^d,they go out a lot?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i've had two or three of those go out
sd,"one was under warranty,"
sd,"and the other two weren't,"
%,"but, i just, -"
sd,"other than that, you know, t v -s and things like that, i haven't ever had any trouble with"
sv,i don't think products are getting much better though
aa,yeah
sd,see i'm in the manufacturing -
sd,home from work -
sd,"and make, um, automotive air bags, the safety air bags -"
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,yeah
ba,that's interesting
sd,"at morton international, -"
%,"and, i thin-, -"
sd,"well, it's, it's changed a lot with the manufacturing environment"
sd,"we test everything after each assembly process,"
sd,"and so our testing is pretty thorough,"
%,but -
qy,"do you, do you test each individual one "
%,um
qrr," or do you just test, -"
qy^d,"like if you've got ten, you test one,"
qy^d,and by the test results of the one you assume that the other nine are okay?
no,"um, the tests that, -"
na,"well, we test every one electrically"
%,"we don't, -"
sd,"i think they test four or five a day, actually exploding the air bags "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, but we do test after, during the assembly project, product, um, after we assemble each part of the inflator or what explodes the bag, we check to make sure it's there after we install it,"
sd,"so, each assembly process has an inspection right after it's done,"
sd,"and then we do electrical tests on them during the process,"
%,so -
sd,"well, that's something i've never had to use,"
sd,"it's never, i've never been involved in an automobile accident,"
sd,"so, luckily that's a product that i haven't had to test"
b, yeah
sd,but i think it's a great idea
%,"i'm, i'm, -"
sd,seems like all the good logical ideas take forever to come about
%,but that -
sd,"well, they do the, all the testing that we have to do through the government,"
sd,it's incredible how much testing they have to do
sv,"oh, i'm sure they want to be thorough before they -"
%,"but, uh, even, -"
sd,"you know, i don't mind spending the extra money on the car "
b,uh-huh
sd,"i'm not a real big seat belt, -"
%,"my, uh, -"
qy,"are you a vietnam veteran, dudley? "
nn,"uh, no"
bh,no?
qy,do you have family who were in the vietnam war?
nn,"uh, no"
sd,"my father was, uh, came in right after world war two"
bk,okay
qy^d,"so he was too old,"
qy,"and you were too young, right?"
na,"i am too young, yeah"
bk,all right
qy,do you know some folks who have been there?
ny,"uh, yes"
bk,okay
sd,a couple
b,okay
qo,how did it influence them?
sd,"uh, the, the one guy i worked with down in austin hated it"
sd,"uh, he was a lineman down there"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and while he was there, he caught some kind of a strange disease"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, all his hair fell out,"
sd,and he had like a hundred and five fever for a while
%,"and,"
b,uh-huh
qw,"uh, what about long lasting effects on him?"
qy,has he still suffering from those problems?
sv,"i do not think he was in combat,"
b,uh-huh
%,"so,"
sd,"well, i have talked with a number of vietnam veterans,"
sd,"and i really, i had no one directly related to me involved"
sd,"but, uh, my sister's husband was in vietnam"
sd,"and it, it really made a completely different man out of him"
b,uh-huh
sd,"he went to vietnam one man and came back another, not better"
b,yeah
sd,"then, uh, another friend of mine went,"
sd,and he was in combat
sd,"but he came back,"
sd,"and he said, ""okay, that is it that is behind me i am going on with my life"""
sd,much like what roger staubach did
b,right
qy^d,"he was, uh, he was a vietnam war veteran"
ny,yeah
%,"and, uh, -"
sd,"but he was in the navy, though,"
b,yeah
ba,that is true
sd,it makes a lot of difference
b,right
sd,"and, but, uh, most of the folks that i have met that were actually on the land, or in combat, are still, still carry a lot of anger"
b,uh-huh
sd,they really do
sv,"and, uh, i, i, i, i really do not think that we did those young men right"
b,huh
sv,"i think that, uh, desert storm,"
b,"oh, yeah"
%,uh < >
sv,"well, the armed forces did so much to, you know, agent orange,"
sv,they did so much to their own people all during that time
b,yeah
ba,that is true
sv,"you know, and they ta-, they take a,"
b,yeah
sv,"if you come back and your leg is blown off,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"well, you know, one of the most troublesome things that i have encountered as a result is the incredible influx of southeast asians into this country "
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sv,"uh, not so,"
sv,but there is just such a surge of southeast asians
sv,"it has affected the culture of this country, uh,"
ba,"oh, yeah"
sd,"it's ab-,"
b,yeah
b,yeah
b,yeah
sv,"well, uh, the culture is changing"
sv,"look how much more oriental food we have, restaurants now,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, even ten years ago, there were not that many"
sv,"a lot of shops are, are operated by southeast asians"
ba, that's true 
sv,a lot of people have complained in the schools
sv,there is a culture change there
sv,"the southeast asians seem to be very hungry,"
sv,there seem to be very studious
sv,"and, uh, tends to cause our kids to really have to buckle down to keep up with them, which is not bad"
b,no
sv,not really
sv,"uh, but it might in the long run you can see where scholarships, for example,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and that is all a result of, of, of vietnam"
sv,"and, and you see a lot of,"
b,yeah
%,"that is, -"
sd,"uh, and it concerns me that there is probably a lot of mixed breed youngsters still there"
b,uh-huh
sd,and i would be concerned or interested to find out how they are doing now
sv,"well, they are probably not doing very well at all"
%,"i know that there, -"
sv,"because i know there is, there is still people even in the dallas area"
sv,"there are, there are still people trying to get some member of their family back from, uh, vietnam"
qy,you are talking about p o w -s 
%,"uh,"
%,"uh,"
sd,"na-, native vietnamese people"
bf,native vietnamese people
aa,yeah
b,okay
sd,"they were lost, you know, when they were little,"
sd,"and, and they c-, never did get back"
%,"or, -"
%,"oh, i had not -"
sd,"that, that had not occurred to me"
b,yeah
sv,that would be 
sv,"and, uh,"
sd,they didn't regain any of the land that they had
sd,"it spilled over into, uh, now i can't even think of the country"
%,"but, -"
qy^d,cambodia?
ny,yeah
b,uh-huh
sv,"and,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,"and they were not really fighting, you know,"
sv,"it, it would have been the same as desert storm if all they had been fighting was north vietnam"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but, and i am not even sure who was involved more whether it was china or russia"
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, they were pouring, they were pouring weapons in there and, and advising, well, digging tunnels for them"
b,uh-huh
sv,and there is no way that they could ever catch them
sv,"well, i think the terrain had a lot to do with the, the success of desert storm as opposed to that in vietnam"
b,"yeah,"
b,that is right
sd,"you know, there is incredible cover "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and you can't find much cover on, in a sand "
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"all they can do is dig in,"
%,"and they,"
ba,that is right
sd,and then they try to camouflage the top
b,"uh-huh,"
b^m,uh-huh
sv,"well now, even, i think even now, and in vietnam they could probably have done a better job"
sv,"because they could, they could kill all those plants, you know, which would devastate the country as far as farming from then on"
sv,"but, and the, and the corps of engineers i think do a better job now, like they did in desert storm"
%,because 
%,"well, -"
sd,"he, he dug a bunch of moats and filled them with oil "
b,uh-huh
sd, and he set a lot of booby traps all along the way as they went
sd,"and they had to, you know, they had to blow them up or,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"and then they had to fill in little bridges all the way where he, where he had made those moats"
qw,what world war do you think they found the experience for that?
%,"uh,"
qy,don't you think they learned from the mistakes in vietnam?
%,"w-, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,partially
sv,"part of it is that,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
bf,"part of it is technology, yeah"
sv,but 
%,because 
ad,go ahead
sv,"and you say, ""never more"""
b,yeah
sv,"and, and you overcome those problems,"
sv,and you are prepared next time
sv,"i think that is one of the reasons that they have, they have pretty much avoided getting involved in south america"
sv,because 
b,uh-huh
sv,"and they lost him for four hours when they were right on top of him,"
b,right
b,uh-huh
sv,he probably just went right down into a tunnel
b,sure
b,sure
b,sure
sv,"well, i know that, uh, from a personal standpoint, people was one of the finest assets that we lost"
sv,we did not actually physically lose them
sv,"they did not lose their lives,"
sv,but they lost a whole lot of the life they might have had
b,yeah
ba,that is right
sv,"uh, being entirely different people"
sv,i had dinner monday night with a vietnam veteran who is just now beginning to recover from the drug and alcohol struggle that he had
b,uh-huh
sv,that is a long time to suffer
b,yeah
sv,"and they, they really need, -"
sv,"everybody that has, that has stood there, -"
%,"it's, -"
%,"when i-, -"
sv,in vietnam i think it was much closer contact
sv,"you stand there with a rifle and blow a, a piece of somebody apart,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,"and that has to affect you if you are human, you know"
ba,"oh, yeah,"
b,yeah
sv,so they had to 
%,"i can't, uh, -"
ba,"oh, yeah"
ba,"you bet,"
sv,"i do not,"
ba,you bet
sv,"but they can, they can reason and,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sv,"well, you see that is what the veterans are so angry about now"
sd,"they say, ""well, we're,"
sv,but that does not undo the ones that were done
sv,and that is what makes the veterans angry
b,right
sd,and i cannot blame them
sd,i do not know a solution
b,uh-huh
sd,but i sure cannot blame them for being angry
sv,"on the other hand, you know, you can be angry about something for a very long time,"
sv,"or you can say, ""well, that is the way it is,"" and go on with your life"
%,"uh,"
b,right
sd,"for the most part, i wish that it had not happened"
b,yeah
sd,but it did
sv,"and that,"
sd,"and, and, and they f-, initially got into it because of eisenhower"
sv,"and he just, he did not want to be in it any more than, than what we started out in august with desert storm"
ba,"oh, yeah"
sv,and then it just blew up into the war
sv,"well, it has been that way for a very, very long time, though"
sd,"i can remember when i was in the sixth grade,"
sd,and that was many years ago
b,uh-huh
sd,we were reading about the french 
b,"french, yeah"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, and, and, and the asians historically have always had these kinds of wars going on"
b,"right, yeah"
sv,"there, there has not been a lot of peace in that part of the world"
b,uh-huh
h,"i really, i do not know,"
sv,"i-, we should not have maybe gotten involved"
sv,"but if we did, we certainly should have supported our people who were there"
b,yeah
sv,more so supported them when they got home
b,right
sv,"and, uh, i am afraid that they were treated as castaways for the most part"
ba,exactly
sd,"and i, i saw the movie,"
sv,and i think it did a good job depicting the temperament of the times
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sv,"more than, what was, apocalypse now "
b,uh-huh
qy,"well, dudley, have we pretty well discussed the subject?"
b,yeah
sv,i think so
sv,"well, i think so"
fc,i enjoyed talking to you
fc,"yes,"
fc,it was nice talking to you
fc,uh-huh
fc,"okay,"
fc,bye-bye
fc,bye-bye
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sv,"for as far as, um, i would think the, probably the, uh, worst substance that's probably, um, -"
%,"or, started to say the, uh, -"
sv,what causes the most air pollution is probably the car 
ba,"probably so,"
sv," and, uh, whether or not, um, they'll ever get into like huge transit systems into big cities where people would all travel on a high speed, uh, train or, or something like that"
%,"or, -"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,it'll be hard to get people to give up their mobility
aa,"yeah,"
ba,"that's exactly it,"
sd,"and that's what we're finding, um, here, where we're at, in minneapolis area, is that people don't want to carpool "
b,uh-huh
sv,"or maybe you don't like the person you have to, you would want to carpool with, that kind of thing,"
sv,"so it's, it's kind of a thing where, uh, i think the majority of the people do not carpool"
aa,i think so too
sd,i'm in texas 
b,uh-huh
sd, and very few people carpool 
b,yeah
sd," uh, the people that i know don't want to because, uh, they never know for sure what time they're going to leave their job "
aa,exactly
sd," they never know when they want to run out and do an errand at noon, you know,"
b,"uh-huh,"
^2,or if somebody gets sick
b,"yeah,"
sv,"or if somebody gets sick, and it's not the other person "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,you're 
ba,that's right
sv,and people don't want to give it up 
sv, but now i think we've made great strides 
b,uh-huh
b,sure
aa,"sure,"
sd,"that happens quite a bit,"
sv," but, uh, you know, i, i don't guess we can get away from it a hundred percent "
b,"yes,"
b,yeah 
%, but 
ba, that's very true
sd,"uh, other than that, uh, i don't know,"
sd,"well, my other line is ringing "
b,okay
ad, but we're going to ignore it 
aa,"oh, okay, "
ad,we'll try to be real quick here
fa,"i'm sorry for these beeps,"
qw,"the other thing then is, because i don't know how long they want us to talk,"
sd,"oh, close to five minutes, i believe"
b^m,"five minutes, oh, okay"
qy^d,"and you're in minneapolis,"
na,"minneapolis area,"
qy,"well, is the pollution really bad up there?"
ng,"uh, actually no"
sd,"we have, uh, quite a bit, uh,"
sv,the only problem that we have and that's all over the whole world is ozone 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd," you get some pollutants such as those,"
sv,but those are natural 
b,yeah
%," um, but there is starting to, -"
sd,"in minneapolis itself, because of so many people on the highway, there is becoming a problem of pollution,"
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"and if that's the case, then you have to get your car fixed,"
sd,well 
%,at least where you -
sd,"we have just had that law, i think, about a year, maybe a year and a half here in texas "
b,"sure,"
b,"yeah,"
sv," but, uh, i think it's a good idea "
aa,"yeah,"
sv,it's not a bad idea
b,uh-huh
b,"sure,"
b,"sure,"
sv," and, uh, but if they are polluting the air, they need, do need to have them fixed "
aa,"exactly,"
sd," and you know, there's a big move, especially in the industrial part in texas right now of controlling the c f c -s "
b,uh-huh
b,sure
b,uh-huh
%," uh, they can't use, -"
sd,"like, i have a friend that's in the air conditioning heating business "
b,uh-huh
sd," and they have to pay a penalty for every ounce or pound of this certain type of freon that they use in the air conditioning syst-, systems "
b,sure
sd," therefore, the individual, every time they have a service call, if they have an old unit that's still using this twenty-two freon or whatever "
b,uh-huh
b,sure
sd," and, uh, if you have a new high efficiency system that uses the new type of freons that do not release as many c f c -s into the atmosphere "
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
b,sure 
%,"but, -"
sv," uh, the other thing when you're talking about freon with cars, uh, air conditioning, i'm sure "
b,uh-huh
b,right
sv,but it's uncomfortable 
b,uh-huh
sd," but, uh, this year my husband recharged our freon because it was, needed to be done,"
sd,and one of the cans released entire amount 
%,um
sd,"and, i don't know "
b,uh-huh
sd,and i was thinking how many other people -
sv,"it's probably happened to millions of people,"
ba," oh, sure,"
sv,because 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv," so i have this feeling that freon probably will increase in price because it is something that people will have to take into consideration and say, hey, that's "
b,uh-huh
sd,"i think it's like three or four dollars a, a can "
b,yeah
sd," and it takes about four to five cans to fill up a air conditioning unit in a car,"
sd,"and i, i thought about that,"
sd,and my husband even was kind of woozy after that because i'm sure he breathed it 
^2,"inhaled so much of it,"
b,uh-huh
sd," but, uh, you think about that, all the people that are using freon and things like that"
b,"yeah,"
%,"well, of course in the, uh, -"
sv,"i think you probably noticed in the discount stores and places, in the hair sprays "
aa,exactly
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
qy,"well, are you a fisher person, are you?"
ny,"yes,"
sd,i love to fish
ba,great
qw,what kind of fishing do you do?
sd,"well, it's mostly from the rivers and lakes"
qy,in california?
ny,"and, yes,"
sd,and from the banks
sd,i don't like to go out on boats
b,oh
qw,"well, what kind of fish do they have in your neck of the woods?"
%,"well, it, uh, -"
b,uh-huh
b,oh
sd,"but, i like it all except, uh, really i don't, i don't really care that much for the trout"
sd,i think i had rather have a catfish than i would a trout 
sd,"well, i, i don't blame you"
sd,"i grew up in nebraska and, uh, grew up fish, cat fishing in the little blue river"
sd,"and then, uh, we moved to, uh, south dakota "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, now that we are down here, i think a lot of people do some, uh, bass fishing and strip bass fishing"
sd,"but, uh, i still, uh, i am sort of a catfish man at heart"
qy,"see well, uh, like in, uh, iowa and nebraska, those little bullheads, they look just like catfish, huh?"
ny,yep
ny,"yeah,"
sd,they do
sd,you know that's what i mean cause i am from iowa
b,oh
sd,"and, uh, you know, we use to catch those little bullheads"
%,"and that's, -"
sd,they look just like baby catfish
b,yeah
qy,"you know, uh, did you get to go fishing very often?"
ny,oh yeah
sd,i like to fish
sd,the only problem is i just moved to texas
sd,so it's been a little over a year now
sd,"but, uh "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i, so really i haven't gone fishing for about two years now "
b,uh-huh
sd, and it's driving me crazy
sd,"but, uh, one of these days, i will go over to, uh, lake lewisville or, uh, what is it, uh ray hubbard, lake ray hubbard and get some fishing in and get it out of my system for a while "
b,uh-huh
qy,"well, uh, you like to eat them after you catch them?"
ny,"well, yeah,"
sd,sure
sv,"because there's are a lot of people that like to go fishing,"
%," well mo-, -"
b,yeah
sd,"most of the time, uh, if we catch something, we'll take it home and eat it"
aa,"uh, and you're right"
sd,i mean i like to fish for trout
sd,"and they are really, uh, uh, good fighters"
sd,"but, uh, if i went to a restaurant that probably wouldn't be the first thing i would order if i had a choice of fish on the menu"
b,"yeah,"
ba,i know
b,yeah
qy," well, uh, so, do you just, uh, uh, skin your catfish"
qrr,"or do you fillet them out,"
qw,"how do you, how do you, -"
sd," we, uh, skin them"
^g,do you?
ny,yeah
bk,okay
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,just cut their heads off and skin them
sd,"and then i just, uh, flour them, salt and pepper them and cook them"
b,yeah
sd,i don't put that corn meal on them
nn,no
sd,"you know, uh, that's the way my mother taught me to fry them"
%,"so , -"
sd,"well, that's how we do it too"
sd,"uh, although we, uh, use to set some, uh, trout lines out"
sd,"and we've caught, you know, fourteen, fifteen pound catfish"
sd,"and sometimes those are good to, uh, do on a barbecue grill "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd, and then the skin just basically scrapes right off
%,"and, uh, wer-, -"
sd,and it really tastes pretty good
b,yeah
sd,"well you know, i don't think i've ever tried cooking those, uh, catfish quite that big"
%,"there, uh, -"
sd,"uh, most of them are just the small, you know, pan frying ones"
b,yeah
%,"so, uh, -"
sd,"well, i am hoping one of these days i'll have the opportunity to catch a big catfish like that on, uh, a rod and reel"
sd,"but, uh "
b,um
%,"so, -"
qy, wouldn't that be something?
ny,yeah
ny,yeah
sd,"and, uh, well up in, uh, south dakota on the, in the missouri river there we've, uh, tied into a few northern pike"
%,"and, uh, they really, uh, -"
%,"in, in, -"
sd,"when the water is cold, they are very slow moving fish,"
sd,"but in the summer time, they'll, uh, give you a run for your money"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so when you were, -"
qw,when you did go fishing where did you go?
qw,you moved there from where?
^g,nebraska?
ny,uh-huh
ny,yeah
qy^d,"so, it was just like the rivers and, uh, the "
qy,"in,"
ny,yeah
ny,"uh, yeah"
sd,"most of the time, uh, we just fished, uh, in the river although there were a lot of sand pits and things like that, that we could fish in"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"and a lot of them ended up being close to the river,"
sd,"so if the river every, uh, flooded, you know, then obviously they would dump some catfish and bass and stuff into the into the ponds and the sand pits "
b,uh-huh
sd, and so we would do a lot of fishing there too
sd,"but, uh, south dakota didn't really have much for, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
b^m,"okay,"
qw,where have you all been on vacation recently?
sd,"recently,"
sd,"my most recent trip was last year,"
sd,and that was detroit
br,detroit?
ny,yeah
qy,is that a nice vacation spot?
ng,"well, it wasn't really"
sd,"it was, um, uh, to see an old relative"
bk,"right,"
bk,okay
sd,"and it was, uh, just to, uh, have some fellowship with her"
b,right
qy^d,so you probably wouldn't recommend that as a big tourist spot?
nn,no
sd,"the only thing that i, i visited that, you know, is quite a tourist spot is cancun, mexico"
ba,"ooh, that would be nice"
sv,"and that was real nice uh,"
qy,did you scuba dive there?
nn,"no,"
sd,we just kind of walked the beaches and looked at all the beautiful scenery there
ba,"ooh, that would be nice"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"and just kind of relaxed and unwound a little bit,"
ba,"oh, that would be enjoyable"
b,"right,"
b,"yeah,"
ba,"that's,"
b,huh
sd,i haven't been on vacation in a while either
sd,"um, usually when we go, we go to colorado, to estes park area"
b,uh-huh
b,yes
ba,"oh, that's always refreshing to get away from"
sd,so it's a lot of fun
sd,"i worked up there last summer,"
sd,"so i guess it was kind of like a vacation the,"
ba,"oh, well, that's nice"
b,yeah
sd,"worked at a camp there,"
sd,and so i got to spend a lot of time up in the mountains
sd,so that's probably my favorite place when i have to go somewhere on a vacation
sd,"well, my, uh, my middle daughter and her husband have just taken up a new activity,"
sd,and that's canoeing
b,oh
sd,"and, uh, they've been to the guadalupe river,"
sd,"and they also, uh, uh, have been to, uh, i guess colorado,"
sd,and they've really enjoyed it
ba,that's nice
sd,"we, um,"
sd,"it's a whole new, -"
b,uh-huh
sd,and that's the best place that i've ever canoed
%,huh
sv,"it's really, really pretty"
sd,"i was a little kid then,"
%,"and we to have, uh, -"
sd,we stayed at some park
sd,"and they had a little uh, mountain man who came down the river every night,"
sd,and he would give a little talk about mountain things
sd,"you know, i think he wasn't a real mountain man,"
sd,"but we were pretty convinced he was a full,"
b,sure
b,uh-huh
sd,"and we would have to, we'd -"
sd,and he'd make sassafras tea out of sassafras roots that he'd found
sv,"and,"
ba,"oh, that's neat"
b,sure
sv,"and then the river was really nice because it wasn't too frightening,"
sv,"but it wasn't,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"it was like, -"
sv,"well, you learn a lot of, um, skills too,"
sv,"and i think you're more receptive when you're younger than when you're older, to learn new skills,"
aa,that's true
sv,"and i think they really it really pen-, penetrates in your memory, you know, what to do, because you really have a great interest in it"
b,uh-huh
b,right
sv,so you have kind of a relaxed mode of learning
b,yeah
sv,and you're more receptive
ba,"well, that's good"
^h,"well, we, um, let's see, -"
sd,"the only other place i've ever vacationed, we'd, you know, go on camping trips up to texoma and things like that"
b,uh-huh
sd,and then i went to england 
ba,"oh, that's exciting"
sd,"i was a,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"and that was a great time, because it's so, that's such a neat place"
sd,"and it's, there's not a language barrier"
%,"so you don't, -"
sd,"i mean, there there's a little bit, because there's some of those english words that you just don't exactly know what they mean,"
sv,"and a lot of people have trouble wrestling with their accents,"
sv,"but it's, it was really fun"
sd,"i, i, i really enjoyed that"
sd,"i'm probably going back there to work,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, i had a friend that, uh, visited england not, well, i think it's been probably two years now,"
sd,"but that's her next goal, and she can do it, is go back to england,"
sd,"because she really has a great desire to do that,"
sd,"because the love that she, um, has for it now after visiting it -"
sv,"it, it's really nice"
sd,"i would, i would spend all my time in london,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and that's it was really different being in a big city,"
sd,"because i don't get much into urban, you know, really urban areas a lot "
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd," and it was, it's really, it's sort of a weird little anonymous feeling where no one knows who you are"
sd,"and you can spend a whole day without talking to anyone, which i thought i would just hate,"
sd,but it ended up being kind of nice because you're not accountable to anyone
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"you could just kind of ,"
^2,do your own thing
b,yeah
sd,i did a lot of just going out by myself and riding on the subway and watching people
b,uh-huh
sd,and i had a great time doing that
sv,it was really interesting
ba,that's wonderful
sv,"there's a lot out there to see,"
b,"yeah,"
ba,"i know,"
ba, i'll say 
sd,"i keep wanting to get up to, -"
sd,"i haven't, i haven't been anywhere else outside the united states"
sd,"i haven't been to mexico or canada or, -"
sd,"well, i lived across the street almost from canada "
b,oh
sv,"so that was, that, that's a nice place"
sv,canada is very nice
b,"yeah,"
sv,that would be nice
sd,i had a friend from there
b,uh-huh
sd,"then i, i'd love to go somewhere in asia,"
sd,but i'd have to have a tour guide with me to 
aa,"oh, yes,"
aa,absolutely
b,"sure,"
bf,somebody that knows their way around
aa,"so, yeah,"
sd,"that's why, that's why england was nice"
sd,"even, we traveled in europe for about a week,"
sd,"and that was even nice because there wasn't, uh, the, -"
sd,"most the places we went, we went to germany and switzerland and, -"
qy^d,"well, you've been quite a few places there "
ny,"yeah,"
sd,we have 
sd,we 
ba," once you think about it, huh"
b,uh-huh
sd,"it was just insane twelve days where we'd just stop like a city a day,"
sd,and you slept on the train at night
ba,"oh, that's great"
%,"but there wasn't a, -"
sv,"it was strange,"
sv,"it was kind of sad,"
sd,"there wasn't ever a language problem there, because everyone in germany knew english"
sd,"and everyone in switzerland,"
b,uh-huh
ba,that's great
sd,so we were kind of pitiful
sd,"we found one restaurant we were in and got seated,"
sd,"and then no one knew english in there,"
sd,"and we were just ,"
b,uh-huh 
%,"but it was, -"
qw,what did you wind up with? 
sd,"oh, i had fondue"
sd,that was easy to say 
bk,"oh, okay "
sd,"tried to get fondue and white wine,"
%,"and that was, -"
b,"uh, uh-huh"
sd,"we were able to have that pretty, pretty effortlessly"
sd,"there were some people at the next table who spoke english,"
sd,"so we ,"
bf,they kind of guided you
sd,"and,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so,"
ba,"well, good"
sd,"i'd, i'd love to go back there"
sd,there's just not time 
sv,"there's not enough time to go see everything, and then to afford to see everything"
sv,"i guess that's why we need to plan for retirement, so when we do have the free time, we'll have the, the means to, uh, pursue our dreams"
b,right
%,"that's < >, -"
b,yeah
sv,i guess that's what retirement is all about
sv,that and sleeping late 
b, yes
sd,i keep hoping for
b,uh-huh
fc,well 
sd,i understand that
fc,"well, it was nice talking with you too, craig"
fc,and have a good afternoon
fc,you do the same
fc,okay
ft,thank you
fc,good-bye
fc,bye-bye
qy,do you see anything wrong with public school systems?
ny,"well, yes,"
sd,i do
sd,"um, i think i'm concerned about the large number of children that each teacher is expected to, to deal with in some quality way"
sv,i think maybe we've given our teachers a almost impossible job
aa,i agree
qy,do you?
qy,do you have children in the public school system?
ny,"yes,"
sd,and i taught for fourteen years 
b,is that right
sd,"and the, the one thing i see is changing is i was held accountable so much"
sd,"i had to document and create a paper chase for all of my students,"
sd,and instead of spending my time coming up with creative learning stations and things like that i was filling out all these forms 
bf,you were a bookkeeper 
b,oh
sd," everything had to be documented,"
sd,"and i had file cabinets that weren't filled with neat stuff for kids,"
sd,it was filled with documentation 
ba,"oh, no"
aa, yes
sd,"well, um, i'm, i have three years toward a teaching degree and am trying to get headed back,"
sd,"and, and i'm just really in a dilemma if that's what, you know, -"
sd,i love to work with children and 
sd,"me, too"
sd,"but i'm really having questions if, if i can deal with that system and, and have a good conscience about, you know, what i do"
sv,"i don't think, i don't think it's the teachers,"
sv,i think it's the system 
aa,i think so too
%," but, um -"
sv,they're so worried about lawsuits and the scores the children get on tests now 
b,right
sv,"and it's not like the teacher can just get in there and do her best,"
sv,she's always worried who's looking over her shoulder
%,"and, -"
sv,what child's going to say something 
aa,that's right
aa,i know
aa," that's, that's true"
sv,"well, it's, it's hard on the children too,"
sv,"i think, you know, because the, um, the teachers are overworked"
sv,and just like a mommy that's overworked 
aa,that's right
qy,do you have children in the system?
na,"i have two,"
na,"i have, in the system -"
sd,one is in ninth grade
sd,"and one is in seventh grade,"
%,"and them, -"
sd,"um, i'm home schooling my kindergartner this year"
bk,oh
sd,"we, um, live in a district that has open classrooms,"
sd,and i wasn't particularly comfortable with that for her
b,yep
qy,are you in plano?
ny,yes
b,"yep,"
sd,i am too
b,you too
sd,and i have one in ninth grade at clark
sd,"and one at hendrick this year,"
sd,"and he, my nin-, my, uh, sixth grader came from an open classroom at matthews,"
sd,"and the very first year i taught back in seventy-three, we had open classroom"
sd,and it didn't work then 
b,oh
sd," and when we moved down here, i was just appalled that they were still doing "
b,still at it
sd,"well the explanation i was, was given about, you know, -"
sd,"they, they seemed to admit that it wasn't working,"
sd,"but they didn't have the money to restructure,"
sv,"but looks to me that it wouldn't take really that much money to at least come up with, i mean, some kind of partitions "
b,partitions 
sv, or just to face the children different directions or to do something 
%,"just, -"
%,yeah
sd, i know last year my son had to eat in the classroom because there was no cafeteria at his school 
ba,"oh, goodness"
sd, so he spent all day 
b,oh
sd,"so, i didn't really care for that"
sd,it seems like the schools in michigan were much better than they are down here
bh,were they?
sd,"that was our last tour, in michigan"
sd,"well, we were from north, um, carolina,"
sd,"and of course north, north carolina has a terrible reputation as far as education"
sd,i think they rank about forty-ninth 
b,oh
sd, but our children got a very good education there 
b,uh-huh
sd," they were in the magnet school program,"
sd,"and a lot of their classes, from the time they were about third grade, they, they changed classes several times during the day, which has its pros and cons,"
sd,but a lot of their classes there were only eight or ten children in their classes 
ba,"oh, wow"
sd, and it was wonderful 
aa,yes
sd," so, you know, i'm coming to, to plano thinking, well, gosh, it's going to be really great,"
sd,it's ranked so much better 
aa,"yes,"
aa,that's right
sd,we heard wonderful things about it until we actually got in the system
ba,"isn't that interesting,"
sv,"i, i, i don't understand how they get this, this reputation unless it's just that they spend a lot of money,"
h,i don't know
aa,"probably so, on publicity and letting realtors know and key people how wonderful the schools are "
aa,i guess so
%, so -
sd,"well, my son is at clark this year too,"
%,"so, uh, we're -"
qy,as a freshman?
ny,yeah
b,yep
sd,"and, uh, he's pleased with his classes"
sd,"i, i, i don't guess i've been in the high school long enough to, to know what to expect really "
b,yeah
sd,"my daughter seems to be having a good time,"
sd,"she was absent with strep throat the last three days,"
sd,"and i ran over and picked up her report card,"
sd,"and she did very good,"
sd,so 
ba,"well, that's good"
b,yeah
sd,"she's not bogged down,"
sd,but yet she has some every night
sd,"well, eric seems to have quite a few nights where he doesn't have any,"
ba,"so, that's interesting,"
sd,"but, he, his grades, i haven't seen them yet,"
sd,"but supposedly they're good,"
%,"so, -"
b,"yes,"
sv,you always hear how good
sd,"now my son's at,"
qh,"but,"
aa,that's right
qo,"so, how do you feel about capital punishment?"
sd,"well, i, i'm not really certain how i, uh, i'm not certain that, that it does a lot of good i mean, that it ends up, ends up effectively, uh, uh, uh, avoiding a lot of the crimes that have capital punishment "
b,"right,"
%," you don't think, -"
h,"yet, on the other hand, uh, i don't know,"
%,"i mean, there is things that -"
sv,"seems like it's, it's, it's the right thing to do"
sv,"now, you know, i mean somebody, a s-, s-, serial killer or somebody goes in and machine guns, you know, fifty, fifty children in a school yard,"
%,"you kind of, -"
h,i don't know
qo,what about yourself?
sd,"i, uh, i have the same dilemma, i think uh,"
sv,"it's, you know, it seems right sometimes"
sv,"and then other times, you don't know"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh,"
%,"i mean, people, like, -"
%,"i, -"
%,"it's been, -"
sv,"i mean, like the arab societies and stuff end up, uh, having e-, effective, effective punishments"
sv,"and, and they're extremely severe"
sv,"uh, i, you know, i think to a certain degree, the reason that it, it doesn't serve as a deterrent, uh, may be because y-, you never know if it's going to be a-, applied right,"
sv,"un-, unlike, uh, like in, in arab societies if you get, get caught stealing, they chop off your hand"
sv,and 
b, right 
sv,"and everybody knows exactly what, what for"
b, right 
sv," uh, and, you know, and here, with our court system and, and ways of sort of screwing it around and stuff you can, you can kind of always count on the fact, -"
sv,"or, or there is a good chance you're going to get off"
aa,uh-huh
sv,"and also, it doesn't seem like it does that many harm,"
sv,"i mean, sure, their life is taken,"
sv,"but they'd spend the rest of their life in jail anyway,"
sv,so 
sv,so it's more of the easy way out than 
%,"some people, -"
b,yeah
sv,"except that, i mean, the, the average cost to si-, to society of having somebody in jail for all their life is, is extremely high i mean, something, i, i was amazed at uh, uh, per year,"
sd,it's something like twenty thousand dollars per inmate per year
b,yeah
sv,"uh, you know, and it's sort of a , sort of a crass perspective "
b,uh-huh
sd,"but on the other hand, uh, uh, you know, i don't, i don't know if it's that is, that is that serious that they're really never going to be out of jail, uh "
aa,"right,"
sd,"but then again, also, you can't bring back lives that have been taken anyway,"
%,so 
b,uh-huh < >
%,"it doesn't, -"
%,"it seems by, that by, -"
h,"i don't know,"
%,"doesn't ever really, p-, uh -"
aa,"oh, i know,"
%,"i mean, you can't, -"
sv,"it doesn't,"
b, yeah 
aa, right
aa,"it doesn't bring back every, -"
b,"yeah,"
h,"i don't know, i, i don't, i really don't know, uh,"
qw,what state are you in?
sd,i'm in texas
bh,"oh, really?"
%,"w-, w-, -"
qy,in dallas?
nn,"no,"
sd,i'm in austin
bh,"oh, really?"
qw,"where, where are you calling from?"
sd,"uh, right now i'm in utah,"
sd,"but i'm from plano, texas"
bk,"oh, i see,"
%,uh-huh
qw,"so, uh, uh, what are the laws like in texas?"
%,"it's, texas is, has, is one of the, one of the s-, well, -"
sd,"i guess there is more and more states that are, that are going back to capital punishment"
sd,"uh, texas has had it for a while"
sd,"it's one of the quickest,"
%,"it, it, -"
sd,"once it was, it was reallowed, -"
sd,"i think it was outlawed for a while, but, uh, by the supreme court, i mean, or, the interpretation of the constitution"
sd,and it seems like everybody stopped
sd,"and then, and then once they sort of reallowed it, texas was one of the first to, uh, to actually, uh, implement it again"
bh,"oh, really?"
sd,"they do it by, uh, by, do it by lethal injection"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, i'm originally from kansas"
sd,"and in kansas also, uh, they, they almost immediately put back capital punishment"
sd,"and, uh, there they do it by hanging"
ba,wow
%,"still, uh, they have, -"
sd,"i still remember the, the, the movie, uh, in cold blood"
qy^d,"i don't know if you've ever, -"
qy^d,"i'm sure you're familiar with it,"
qy,"but, have you seen the movie?"
ng,"i haven't,"
nn,no
b,yeah
sd,that way
qy,and they do it that way?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"well, they, they show it,"
%,"not, not, -"
sd,"i mean, the, the movie was made in, like, nineteen sixty-two or something like that "
b,huh
sd," and so it's, uh, it's not particularly graphic,"
sd,"but on the other hand it's, it's fairly impressive to watch them, you know, walk into the room with gallows"
sd,it's kind of a barn like structure
ba,wow
sd,"i think they're there,"
sd,"i think that capital punishment is, is, uh, in t-, in utah also"
sd,i'm not really familiar
bh,is that right?
qy,are you there in school?
ny,"yeah,"
sd, i am 
b, yeah 
%,"so, but i think they d-, -"
sd,"a long time ago, i, i remember my dad was telling me this, i think, that, uh, they do it by, like, a bunch of men have guns"
sd,and one of them has the real gun in it
b," uh-huh,"
%,"has, has a, -"
%,yeah 
sd," so they don't know who killed, -"
qy^d,has a real bullets -
qy^d,and the rest of them have blanks?
na,right
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i, i certainly wouldn't want to be the executioner,"
aa,i know that 
b,"yeah,"
aa,no
sd,"i've always said that if i, if i had to kill and clean and do my own, my own meat, i think i'd become a vegetarian"
aa, i know
sv,"as long as you're sort of safely removed from it, it seems, seems not so, so bad, i guess"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","before the one will take, -"
b,"uh, okay,"
^h,"let's see,"
sd,"i guess, uh, i can start"
sd,"i'm actually, we're actually trying to find one now because "
bh,are you really?
ny,yeah
sd,"uh, so i'm looking at, uh, something larger than what we have"
sd,"we've got, like, an eighty-four charger that's about gone and a, uh, an eighty-nine horizon"
sd,"so, i'm looking for something, uh, littler "
b," uh-huh,"
bf,which are both kind of small 
aa,yeah
sd,"uh, so we were thinking mini van for a while"
sd,"and, uh, we're looking at, uh, some just four door, five passenger sedans "
b,uh-huh
qy,are you looking for an american car
qrr,"or, you open to buying foreign cars?"
sd,"uh, i don't really have a preference either way i guess"
b,uh-huh
%,"it's, you know, it, -"
sd,i guess the american cars had a bad reputation
sd,but 
b,uh-huh
b,right
sd,"personally, i have a japanese car right now,"
sd,and i really like it a lot
sv,"uh, i think the japanese really build good cars "
b,uh-huh
sd," and i know that kind of rubs against the grain right now in the whole, uh, you know, buy american, keep american auto workers working right now,"
sv,"but i feel that the japanese have really produced a much higher quality product than our, uh, car manufacturers have for a while"
b,yeah
sd,"if i were to buy another car, i would be, uh, i would be partial to buying another japanese car,"
sd,"but i would also look at american cars,"
sd,"but when i bought the car that i bought now, i did that also"
sv,and i just felt that the japanese car was a much better product
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i mean, e-, "
sd,"so, if i were, -"
b,right
%,"i j-, -"
sd,"there's a door seal that s-, doesn't quite seal"

%,"right now, -"
sd,the next car i buy is going to be sort of a sports car
sd,i would really like to have a sports car
sd,"uh , i don't really, i don't have a family,"
sd,"so i don't need a, a mini van or such to, uh, haul people around in"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so i'm looking for more a, a two passenger car that, uh, -"
qy^d,"oh, like a miata or something like that?"
^h,"well, i like the miata,"
ng,but i don't like it enough to buy it
sd,"i would buy something, -"
sd,"actually the, the car that i really like right now is an eagle talon, which is an american car"
%,um
sd,"but, uh, something along that lines"
ba,interesting
sd,"uh, because i have a, an economy car right now, which is okay,"
sd,but 
b,yeah
ba,that's interesting
%,"yeah,"
sv,"i guess probably the factors we'd use to compare are a little different because i look for, you know, size and "
b,right
%,"probably,"
b,right
%,"uh,"
%,"that's, -"
sd,"when i bought the car that i bought, i was looking for mileage,"
sd,"and i was looking for, uh, dependability and something that was going to last a long time i was g-, that i would get a, for the money that i was going to spend, that i would get a return that was, that was worth that money"
b,yeah
%,"so, -"
b,yeah
sd,"i c-, i think in terms of computer terminology, i look at, you know, price performance and things like that "
aa," right,"
aa,exactly 
sv,"but it, you know "
b,yeah
sd,"but, you know "
aa,that's right
sd,actually 
b,uh-huh
sd,and she got just a commute between cincinnati and dayton
b,uh-huh
%,"it's, you know, -"
sd,"we, we had to replace the friction plate and the transmission at thirty thousand miles,"
sd,but 
b,uh-huh
%,"so,"
b,okay
sd,"uh, i've had, uh, i've had one or two american cars i think,"
sv,"and, and they were okay"
sd,i had a pontiac once
sd,"and, and i never had a problem with it,"
sd,"but, uh, my mother had a dodge at one point"
sd,"and i, i had driven it a few times"
sd,"and i really did not feel that it, that i would buy a dodge "
%,um
sd,"well, actually, i had a, uh, a dodge omni at one point "
b,uh-huh
sv," and that was, i think, what really prejudiced me against american cars was because i did not feel that it was a very quality, uh, car"
b,yeah
sv,"so, i guess you'd have to say, if i was looking, i would definitely be looking for a foreign car"
ba,that's interesting
%,"but, -"
%,"yeah,"
sv,"it, it's hard to beat some of the, -"
sd,"uh, like, i guess, in particular, we're looking at a, like a ninety-one corsica, uh, buy back at a, they say g m sponsored auction,"
sd,but i think they're obliged to have these things because hertz and avis and those folks have it in their contract that 
b,uh-huh
b,right
sd,"and you can get those for like eight thousand bucks if you, -"
sv,which is a good deal
aa,"yeah,"
%,"because i guess, uh, -"
sd,"i mean, well, ninety-twos, granted, but the new ones, you know -"
b,uh-huh
sd, fourteen to sixteen is what they go for 
b,right
sd,so all the depreciation has been taken off

b,yeah
%,"that, -"
sd,"i don't know what kind of, i don't know what g m corporate, kind of hit the, i don't know what kind of hit they take on it,"
sv,but sounds like everybody's had their chance to make their money off it
h,"and ,"
aa," yeah,"
sv,i'm sure they did
sd,we keep looking at that mini van
%,"it's just, you know, -"
sd,"we can get a, like a caravan "
b,uh-huh
b,right
sd, but that's a little bit more than we want to spend right now
sv,"but, uh, uh, it's interesting,"
h,"but, uh, i don't know,"
sv,"if, if, uh, it seems to be, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
qo,well what do you do on your yard?
sd,"well, uh, typical lawn stuff"
sd,"saint augustine, uh "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd," uh, and really all i do to it is, -"
sd,"uh, in fact, i didn't even fertilize it this year,"
sd,"i just mowed it,"
sd,"and i, i mow it, uh, you know, with a mulch mower so the, the particles fall down "
qy^d,comes back in the yard 
ny, yeah
qy^d, so you don't have any one do your yard
qy,you do it yourself?
na,i do it myself
b,"yeah,"
sd,we do too
sd,have a lot of people trying to do it for me 
ba, isn't that the truth
sv,a flyer's on every door every day
sd,"hey, i need the exercise,"
qh,so what the heck
aa, that's right
sd,"well, we, um, we, my husband does the same thing,"
sd,"he does the yard,"
sd,"and he wants me to learn how to work the lawn mower,"
sd,but i keep putting off learning
sv,"hey, you've got the right idea"
aa,that's right
sd,but i had recently gone out and planted mums
sd,"we had decided to paint the front of the house about three weeks ago,"
sd,and so while my husband was painting i went out and bought about fifty dollars worth of mums over at calloway's 
b,uh-huh
sd, and put out yellow and bronze
sd,"and they're just gorgeous, and so then last week my mom comes in town,"
sd,"and she says well, those are going to die just the first frost"
sd,"she said, you should have done pansies"
sd,"and i went, well, now you tell me"
b,yeah 
sd,"so the first night, that around halloween -"
sd,"and we went out and covered them with a sheet,"
sd,and they did okay that first night
sd,"but the second night we were at the movies and didn't do it,"
sd,so i guess i've lost them
sd,i haven't gone out to check yet
b,"yeah,"
ba,i don't blame you
sd,i wouldn't want to look at them
aa,"no,"
ad,"listen,"
sd,"but, um, the worst problem we've had here with this grass was about the third year we were here"
sd,i guess it was about four years ago
sd,"and we did not know in august to put down the, uh, whatever it is for grub worms"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and the next spring, i guess in that march, every time we would go out and just try to walk on the grass or reach down to pull a weed, we'd have big whole patches come up"
qy,have you ever seen it 
ny,yeah
ny,yeah
sd,"and we pulled up almost half of our yard just by raking it,"
sd,"it would just come off in the rake, down to the dirt"
sd,so we had to go out and resod the whole thing with squares and wet it and put it down and rope it off and everything
sd,"it took a lot of money and a lot of time,"
sd,so the most careful thing we do on our yard every august is put down that diazinon
b,"yeah,"
qy,"you, you think that's what it was, huh"
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,we found them 
bk,okay
b, yeah
sd,we found them
sd,we dug under there about an inch
sd,and you could see them
sd,"they're real fat little white things,"
sd,and 
b,yeah
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"those kind of brown, uh, ju-,"
aa," yeah,"
%,"but in, but in the, -"
b,uh-huh
sd, and some people call them may beetles
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"june bugs is what i'd heard them called,"
sd,"so any how, occasionally i find them in the flower beds"
sd,they said that every yard has some 
b,"uh, yeah"
sd, but it was a preponderance of them that caused our problem
sd,"so that's the number one thing we do, whether we fertilize or anything else, just because we got burned so badly before"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"well, i had some of that problem,"
sd,but mine was freeze
aa,"oh, yeah"
aa,"that too,"
qy,"two years ago, or last christmas "
ny,"yeah,"
ny,yeah
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i'm still 
b,"yeah,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"i caught wolfe with, uh, uh, one, uh, one of the sales where they have those big blocks for fifty cents,"
sd,"and, uh "
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,i guess you did too
sd,it's what they've done in the spring 
%,"uh, well, i put, you know -"
sv," that was late,"
%,"that was like, -"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"because i started to say, you can, there's different times they say it's okay to do it"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"that was like september, i think"
b,yeah
sd,"and i had to water it, you know "
b,yeah 
ba, gosh
b, keep it damp
%,"well, my, -"
sd,"out here, you know, we don't have as many trees in plano,"
sd,"at least the area where, -"
sd,"we're over by collin creek mall,"
sd,"and, but a lot of the shrubbery that we have in the front, like the pittosporum all died,"
sd,"and all those variegated, uh, things died"
sd,"so we pretty much go with that dwarf yaupon and that yaupon holly,"
sd,"and they just live,"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"they're pretty tough, uh,"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"you can, you can stand those"
sd,pittosporum is kind of borderline here 
b,uh-huh
sd," and usually it'll do pretty well,"
sd,"but, uh, you know, every once in a while we get one of these really cold deals "
b,yeah
sd, and it zaps it
%,"well it's kind of like one of these, -"
sv,"oh, wax leaf, wax leaf ligustrum is the same way"
aa,"same way, -"
aa,uh-huh
sd,"that, they, they warned me of that one finally"
sd,"and i said, you know, you need to either read neal sperry's book before you shop or get a reputable nursery, because lot of places that would, are just trying to sell whatever was pretty out there,"
sd,and we didn't know the difference
sd,and every year we learn one more thing that we didn't know before like about these mums
b,yeah
b,"okay,"
sd,"next year, i'll do pansies"
sv,"your list is growing,"
sd,"and my backyard, we had it really nice,"
sd,"and then my husband wanted a labrador puppy,"
%,"and so, it was about, -"
sd,"i guess he's three now,"
sd,so the first summer he was here he dug up all of my bushes and plants 
b,"oh, yeah,"
ba,"oh, gee"
b,um
%,"so, it's like our backyard is just kind of like, -"
sd,"as long as he won't damage it, fine,"
sd,"and if he'll, if there's anything he'll hurt, we just don't put it out there any more"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"kind of cuts your possibilities for the flower beds,"
%,yeah
aa,uh-huh
aa,"very much,"
%,"but, uh -"
sd,"i had a, had a small vegetable garden that, uh, -"
b,you did
sd,"it did pretty well,"
sd,"it's, it's like on the "
b,huh
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, our, our garages come in from the back, you know, from the alley "
sd,"so do ours,"
%,yeah
sd," and, uh, it's, it's a little piece of land over there "
qw,what did you grow?
sd,"well, i had, uh, tomatoes and, and, uh, uh, peppers,"
sd,"and i had,"
ba,that is amazing
sd,"and by the fence i had cucumbers, which, which didn't do real well, uh "
b,yeah
sd, they kind of came out looking like gourds
ad," well, put them in a salad, though,"
ad,"and you say, well, i made it though, at least it's mine"
sd,"but i had squash,"
sd,"i had zucchini and, and yellow crook neck squash,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
ba,great
sd,"um, currently, i'm not doing a whole lot of exercise in any type of program"
b,huh-uh
sd,i'm mainly do a lot of walking
sd,i have a son that's a little bit overweight
sd,"and, um, the best thing we found to do with him is to walk around"
sd,so my wife and i kind of take turns
sd,at one time i had a fairly regular exercise program
sd,"but, in the last couple of months i've changed to a new residence and everything has gotten kind of turned a little upside down"
sd,"all this space that normally would be dedicated towards the,"
b,yeah
qw,"um, what did you do when you did exercise regularly?"
sd,"well, i had, uh, a little routine that i did for warm ups"
b,huh-uh
sd,"and then i did some very mild, say, light weight lifting"
sd,"nothing, -"
sd,"i'm not trying to make big bulging muscles,"
b,huh-uh
b,yeah
sd," um, right now, um, i try when it's nice out,"
sd,"it's been raining a lot this spring,"
sd,"but i try to, uh, -"
sd,i have a bicycle
sd,and i like to cycle a lot
sd,"and, uh, my husband and i, we have entered a few rallies, that's pretty popular in texas,"
sd,"i don't know,"
b,huh-uh
sd,but every weekend a small town will sponsor a rally
sd,"and thousands of people come with their bikes and ride over hilly terrain for thirty or forty miles, which that's a lot of fun"
b,huh-uh
sd,"um, so we try to ride during the week to try and stay in shape for that"
sd,"and, um, t i, where i work has, uh, a fitness center"
sd,"so a lot of time after work or maybe on the weekends, we'd go over there and lift weights and do the tread mill,"
sd,"and, um, they have stair masters and all kinds of new machine, that are fun to ride and workout on"
sd,"so i try to, -"
sd,i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis
sd,"i used to, uh, get into it and get out of it based on my schedule,"
sd,"so i'm trying to stay in shape on a regular basis now,"
sv,but it's a big commitment
sd,we don't have any kids yet
sd,"so, that's a lot of, part of it"
b,yeah
sv,that's a plus
sd,"oh, i have a total of five children"
sd,i have three left living at home
b,huh-uh
sd,"and they do take up a big part of my, uh, my evening and weekend"
b,yeah
sv,"and it's tough being a parent and doing all the things that you should do for yourself, too"
b,yeah
sv,it's something they don't tell you about when you're growing up
aa," yes, "
sv,when you become a parent most of your life is going to be dedicated to your children
b,huh-uh 
sd,"that's why, they, uh, really stress, at t i, they really stress, staying in shape, like stay in fit, overall fitness, you know, no smoking and all that"
sd,"but it's hard to find, uh, an actual exercise regimen that work, for you, you know, because like i know a lot of people that cycle, they take their kids behind them on the bikes"
sd,and i don't know if that would work for me because i don't know i wouldn't want to pull a kid over hilly terrain
sv,"but it's really hard to find something that works, and, you know, to find time to do it and stay committed to it like three days a week or whatever"
sv,i think maybe walking or running would probably work because it doesn't take much time and much money or whatever
b,yeah
b,yeah
sv,"you have to, -"
sv,what i found from my experience is you have to budget time for yourself
b,huh-uh
sv,"and you can use what ever rationale you want,"
sv,"but basically, the healthier you stay, the longer you'll live"
aa,right
sv,"and, uh, you know, if i spend a little bit of time each day or a little bit of time every other day doing something for me to make me live longer, well, then i'll around a lot longer,"
sv,"and those people that i'm taking the ten minutes or twenty minutes away from now, well, you know, get the enjoyment of me, years past where i would have been if i wouldn't have taken it"
b,huh-uh
sv,"if you kind of think of it as a rationale like that, it works out fine"
b,yeah
sd,"um, i've been learning a lot lately about, um, -"
sd,"i've been reading a book by kenneth cooper,"
qy^d,i don't know if you're familiar with him 
b,huh-uh
sd, he was the pioneer of aerobics and all of health really
sd,"he's, he's, kind of, he's pretty much the innovator of the whole exercise thing"
sd,"um, he was talking about the three things you could, that cause aging smoking are inactivity, * mistranscribed? listen"
sd,"and what was the other one, i think was, yeah, obesity"
sd,"if you can control those three areas, then are you going to live longer, you know, cause those are risk factors,"
sd,"so anyway,"
b,yeah
sd,"oh, i've done a lot of study over the years"
sd,and i found that probably one of the worst things that anybody can ingest is chlorinated water
b,really 
b,yeah
sd,"um, the research that i've done -"
sd,and i've actually been in the drinking watering business since eighty-three
b,huh-uh
sd,"and, it's amazing, that, uh, you know, prior to like nineteen-twenty there were very few heart attacks"
b,huh-uh
sd,there were none prior to nineteen-hundred
sd,"well, in nineteen-three they started experimenting with chlorinating the water in nineteen-thirteen most of the major cities,"
sd,"and after that we,"
sd,"and, uh, dr price wrote a book coronary, cholesterol, and chlorine"
sd,you can usually find it in a health food store
b,huh-uh
sd,"i know they had it in health food stores in plano,"
sd,i used live in plano
br,dr price?
sd,"uh, dr price,"
%,yeah
sd,"and it's amazing,"
sd,"he makes the, -"
sd,"you know, it's a very small book"
sd,"and the guys very opinionated,"
sd,"um, but he makes a very good case against chlorine"
sd,there were no heart attacks before we started using it
sd,"and he points out that people in, uh, england -"
sd,"and, uh, or even diets that quadrupled the amount of cholesterol that we're ingesting now,"
sd,and they weren't dropping dead of heart attacks
b,yeah
sd,he did some experiments on chickens whose arteries are very similar to ours
b,huh-uh
b,yeah
%,"and, uh, you know, he's, -"
sd,there's been a lot of reports since then
sd,"this whole thing about, -"
sd,"first it was stress, then it went to cholesterol,"
sd,"and now they're saying what's cholesterol,"
sd,well there's good cholesterol and there's bad cholesterol
b,huh-uh
sd,"you know, it's amazing what he points out in that book"
sd,"and, in fact, he, everyone there was a toxicologist for the environmental protection agency, who did work back in nineteen eighty-six, who wrote a letter to dr price in nineteen eighty-seven and in this letter he praised dr price for the work he did back in the sixties on this and said that e p a had been doing experiments on nonhuman primates and proving that ingestion of chlorine causes arteriosclerosis"
sd,"and, e p a never published that report"
qw,and what's the name of this book again?
sd,"coronary, cholesterol and chlorine"
sd,i'll have to remember that
b,yeah
sd,that will be very interesting
sd,my husband wants to go into medical school and be a neurosurgeon
sd,"so, he's really interested in the heart"
b,yeah
sd,"and he's, in fact, he's a, well, heart, too, -"
sd,"he's, uh, he's done a lot of research on like how your heart reacts to exercise "
fa,"sorry,"
sd,he made me laugh
%,"um, so anyway, -"
b,yeah
sd,"there is, there is a lot of good information out there, uh, about health"
sv,"and a lot of the, a lot of the myths they've been passing around, people are starting to realize aren't true"
b,yeah
sd,"i mean, i'm all for having a diet high in fiber and all that, because that's, that's good for you,"
b,huh-uh
sd,"uh, but to believe some of the things, -"
sd,"you know, and i don't think anybody should be going out there and eating a high fat diet,"
sv,"but to think that solely, alone is going to cause something like arteriosclerosis is, is just hard to believe"
sd,if you get a chance read dr cooper's book on controlling cholesterol
b,huh-uh
sv,"that's a real good,"
sd,"um, he talks about that"
sd,talks about high risk factors and heart disease and all that
b,yeah
sd,i actually eat pretty much anything that i want
b,huh-uh
sd,"and i've had my cholesterol checked and, uh, a few times"
sd,"and i've never been above, like, you know, one-hundred and fifty,"
b,huh-uh
%,"and, uh, uh, i mean, i, -"
sv,you have a good ratio of good to bad
sv,"but, i mean, you know, everything is like within five to ten percent and all that kind of thing "
sv,"you know, they leave themselves wide open so they can't be sued"
b,yeah
%,"but, uh, we've, -"
sd,"i work at the t i site in hunt valley, maryland"
b,"oh, really"
b,yeah
sd,and we've had a few of the health fairs up here
sd,"and, um, you know, i've always come out aces"
ba,that's good
sd,"you know, i'm not really that big on watching what i eat,"
sd,"but i do eat, you know, some health cookies that are high in fiber,"
b,yeah
sd,"but, i mean as far as really being concerned about ingesting too much chlorine, i'm not, cholesterol, i'm not worried about it <<tape fades>>"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",all right
b,okay
ad,"well, i can go ahead and start and tell you mine"
%,"and, -"
aa,okay
sd,we're from san antonio
sd,"and that's where i grew up,"
%," oh, "
sd," so i was used to the heat, out here right now,"
b, yeah 
sd," gosh, it gets to about seventies, high seventies"
sd,and it gets very cold at night
b,uh-huh
sd,"and monterey it's, um, right on the coast"
sd,"and, i don't know if your familiar with california coastline, *your you're"
sd,"but we're we're about two hours, about a two hour drive south of san francisco,"
bk,"oh, okay"
sd,"and it's, uh, really nice"
sd,"it's a big area for people to come from the different, uh, countries, mostly like japan, germany and england"
sd,"and they usually go to carmel and vacation on the beaches,"
sd,"so it's, it's pretty nice, uh, year round"
sd,"but, uh, cool, always cool in the evenings and warm, warm in the summer,"
sd,"but it's stays pretty cold even, uh, during the winter, for as nice as it is"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, um, we usually get a fog uh, right about, i guess, about four o'clock"
sd,and it kind of rolls in over the coast
sd,"and, uh, then it usually breaks back off again the next morning"
sd,"and if you go just a little bit ways in, i'd say about a fifteen minute drive in towards salinas,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,and it gets very hot and dry
sd,and the fog never makes it that far
b,uh-huh
sd,"but along here it's, uh, very , very different from the texas type weather"
qw,what's it like down there?
sd,"well, right now we're we're having the little bit of spring that we have"
b,"oh, really,"
sv,well at least you've got some 
sd,we don't have many seasons here
sd,"it goes from winter to summer, usually"
b,uh-huh
sd,spring usually consists of a lot of rain especially thunderstorms
sd,"we've got, we had one of those blow through tonight"
ba,"oh, well, that's good"
sd,and i think we got the same thing in the forecast for the next two or three days
b,uh-huh
%,so -
qy,"have y'all been having any heat waves or like the ninety degree, -"
sd,"it's gotten up to, uh, ninety a couple of times"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, basically, it's been in the low seventies and eighties"
b,uh-huh
sv,"women, that's good for this time of year"
aa,yeah
sd,it's not really been too bad
b,uh-huh
sd,usually it sneaks on into the nineties a little earlier
b,uh-huh
qy,so do y'all have many bluebonnets and stuff this year?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,quite a bit
b,"oh, uh-huh"
sd,"well, the season is just about over for that,"
sd,"uh, in fact we drove down to corpus last week "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, there were still some paint brushes and bluebonnets down along the way"
sd,"oh, i miss that "
sd, drove through san antonio
sd,and i spoke to somebody else this morning from san antonio
%,"and were, -"
%,"they had, -"
sd,and we came back
t1,"what day was that, sunday evening,"
sd,"and they had a big rainstorm come through there, part of the same thing we're getting now, i guess"
sd,"oh oh, well that's real nice because i can remember two years ago that in about february the hundred degree weather started in san antonio and just continued"
sd,at least y'all are getting some rain up in dallas
sd,i'm glad to hear that 
b,yeah
sd,that's the second or third year in a row that we've had a real rainy spring
b,uh-huh
sd,"we had a pretty rainy fall last year, as well"
qy,y'all weren't getting any of the strings of the tornadoes and stuff were you?
sd,"um, we've had a few down here, but not anything like kansas"
b,uh-huh
sd,but this is the season for that
ba,"oh, gosh"
sd,"they do, they do pop up occasionally,"
b, uh-huh 
b,oh yeah
sd,i really don't miss all the heat there
b,yeah
sd,i'm getting acclimated to have the cool evenings
sd,so we get a bit of a relief
b,yeah
sd,"i'm from here originally,"
sd,"so when it's july and august, i'm pretty well used to the,"
b, uh-huh 
b,uh-huh
b,yeah 
sd,"the biggest problem with, with the weather and the rain in this area is the soil"
sd,it's that black clay soil
qy,"oh is that what dallas is,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc", okay
%,yeah 
sd," you know, it's not sandy like most of the state is,"
sd,so it doesn't absorb the water real well
b,uh-huh
sd,"you know, once it rains a little bit, it's, it's filled up and everything else just runs off,"
b, uh-huh 
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc", you know -
b,yeah
sd,san antonio has that same problem when the rains come
sd,"it's, it's a complete mess, everything floods, all the under passes"
b,yeah
qy^d,i didn't realize that dallas had that same problem
ny,yeah
sd,"we have it,"
sd,especially as rainy as it's been in the last couple of years
sd,and there's a section in south dallas that's had a whole lot of flooding problems because of the rain
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, we could use some rain up here"
sd,"we're like in the bottom of the fourth year of drought,"
b, really 
sd,and they had a pretty good early spring
sd,"and we got quite a bit of rain,"
sd,but it wasn't enough to offset what they lost over the last four years
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, so they're still talking water rationing this summer,"
sd,"so it would seem strange because in san antonio, -"
sd,"we had lived out, um, west of san antonio, in castroville,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and the water in medina lake and that area was really going down, that they were considering that they might have to do water rationing"
sd,"and i thought oh, gee i'm so glad to get out of there and get up here to the california pacific coast where it rains and everything has flowers"
^q,and there's no problem with water
sd,"and then i came here and found out they were in the, you know, four year draught "
b,uh-huh
sd,"so i said, well, gee, this is pretty much like texas"
sd,and it pretty much is in the middle of summer
sd,they have rolling hills around here
sd,"but,"
b, uh-huh 
b, uh-huh 
b,yeah
sd,"but, um, it's a really nice area"
sd,"it's just, it's just such a change from, uh, texas because i had grown up with, uh, the heat,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and used to essentially, -"
sd,"like you said, you have the cold winter"
sd,and then you have the hot summer spring 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, to come here, it's kind of the temperate weather all year round"
sd,"it's kind of like, uh, spring, i guess, if you, year round, except,"
sd,and then in the winter -
sd,"and then it seems sort of like a san antonio early winter or fall,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"so it seems like we only have two springs which is, or two seasons"
sd,and that would be spring and fall
b,yeah
sd,we never really get any of the other ones
b,uh-huh
sd,"but it's a really nice, uh, change of pace"
sd,i guess i'd prefer that 
b, yeah
^2,to the heat
sd,i really don't miss the heat
b,yeah
sd,"um, we do a lot of, you know, -"
sd,"when you do a lot of outside, like running and stuff, it's just so much easier,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,and you don't have to worry about the high humidity
b,yeah
qy,does dallas get high humidity?
qrr,or is it pretty dry
sd,it's pretty dry
sd,"we get some when it's this rainy,"
sd,"but it's nothing like, i guess, san antonio summers,"
sd, it's nothing like houston
x,<<tape is cutting out>>
b,uh-huh
sd," or east texas, is a little more humid"
b,yeah
sd,"it seems like san antonio is increasing in humidity over the years,"
sd,"because i had lived in san antonio for about twenty years,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and it just seemed like every year it just got more and more humid, more and more humid "
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, um, it's not the same as corpus"
sd,"corpus, you get that humid salty feeling in the air"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but here, um, well the water is extremely cold, up here,"
sd,"you can lay on the beach all you want,"
sd,"but if you want to go wind suffering or diving or swimming, you have to wear a wet suit"
b,uh-huh
%,"and i, -"
sd,"for some reason, because of the cold, uh, ocean, uh, water, the air is always cool"
sd,"it's never humid or sticky or salty feeling,"
sd,so i really like that about this area
sd,"and, uh, we just hadn't expected it,"
sd,"we were used to, what, uh, gulf coast weather was like,"
b, yeah 
sd,it's just completely different
sd,and it's much nicer
b,yeah
bf,"probably the pacific breezes make a lot of difference,"
aa,uh-huh
sd,it does
sd,and the air doesn't feel anything like it does along the gulf coast region
%,"but you, um, -"
sd,but we like it
sd,so it's a nice change
sd,so we'll be here a couple of years
sd,"and we thought well, we'll take advantage of it and see what all the pacific coast is like"
ba,that's nice
sd,so it's been good
sd,"well, my wife's originally from virginia"
sd,and we lived there for about nine months
sd,and that was a real change for me
ba,"oh, i imagine"
qy,"virginia, i imagine, gets real humid, doesn't it?"
sd,"um, parts do"
sd,"we, we're over in the western edge in the mountains"
b,oh
sd,"and, they have, of course, some pretty severe storms, winter storms, snow and that type of thing"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but they're so good about clearing the roads, that, you know, it doesn't usually bother you very much"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah 
bf,not like texas where everything comes to a stand still
aa,yeah
sd,"their springs and summers are pretty mild, too"
sd,"it never gets real, real hot"
b,uh-huh
sd,i'll have to try that out because i had heard that north carolina was sort of like that
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, i've just never really been in that region of the country"
sd,and i guess i'm going to have to try that area sometime and see what it's like
sd,because a lot of people that are from that north carolina region really like it
sd,"and, uh, they get the snow,"
sd,but they said it doesn't really get messy
sd,and it doesn't really hang around that long
b,yeah
sd,"so, they, the people i know that are from there, uh, they always miss it"
sd,and they want to go back 
sd,nothing seems quite as good
%,"but, anyway well, -"
sd,"well, as we were talking the weather came on"
sd,"and there's a flash flood watch and,"
ba," oh, gee-whiz "
ba,"oh, gosh"
sd,"well, i hope it moves up this way,"
sv,but i'm sure it won't 
b,yeah
sd,maybe we can send you some 
b, yeah
sd,because we could sure use it
qy,"well, you think that takes care of the time and, -"
na,i think that will do it
aa,okay
fc,"well, i sure appreciate hearing how things are going in texas and, uh, -"
fc,"well, i enjoyed talking with you lisa,"
fc,yeah
fc,good luck to you
fc,uh-huh
fc,"you, too"
fc,okay
fc,we'll see you
fc,bye
fc,bye
qy,"so you like to fish, huh?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i like to,"
sd,"i don't have a boat,"
sd,but i like to fish
sd,and there's a lot of lakes around here
qy,"uh, are there many lakes up there?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,actually there are quite a bit of lakes around me
sd,"we actu-, uh, we have the, those little, the, the, the great lakes, you know,"
%,"grea-, -"
sd,"uh, lake ontario is right near here"
b,uh-huh
sd,"plus, we're in what's called the finger lake region of new york"
sd,where there're lots of small lakes everywhere
sd,"and these are, uh, real good, uh, for, like, you know, bass fishing and so forth"
qy^d,they have mostly small mouth in them
%,"or, -"
nn,"no,"
sd,"we have a, qui-, actually quite a lot of variety"
%,"there's, uh, there's, -"
sd,"we have large mouth, small mouth, uh, sort of musky, pike, stuff like that"
b,uh-huh
sd,"you know, all sorts of fun stuff like that"
sd,"uh, we have a pretty large bass masters tournament actually takes place right on lake ontario every year"
b,"oh, yeah,"
ba,"that's right,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so it's, it's, that's, a lot of fun"
b,uh-huh
qo,how about you?
qw,"do you like, what do you like to go for?"
%,"oh, it's, it's, uh, -"
sd,"i fish for bass,"
sd,"but i hardly ever catch one,"
sd,"but, uh, uh, they have a tail race over in lake lavon "
b,yeah
sd," and, uh, you know, they wash, when they open up the dam and let out water, they wash down the fish"
sd,"and, uh, you catch that white bass and crappie out of there"
b,um
sd,every once in a while there'll be striped bass
sd,"we have, uh, some friends who live on the lake "
b,uh-huh
sv," and, it, the lake it just seems, is, is completely filled with bass to the point where, you know, normally you go, y-, y-, go fishing for bass, you get a lot of sunfish, or, or cat or whatever, and some other strange stuff *listen"
sd,"but in this particular lake, we went out with some friends, once"
sd,"and we just, every time you tossed the line in, you pull up a five, six, seven inch minimum bass"
sd,"and usually you pull up, you know, thirteen to fourteen inch bass"
ba,wow
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"it's a real, it's a real enjoyable experience to go fishing there because we just, we pull up, you know, bass after bass"
b,uh-huh
sd,"probably during, during perch season the perch will run in very large schools,"
sd,"so what they'll do is j-, -"
sd,"you'll, you'll be sort of boating around,"
sd,"these people own a little row boat,"
sd,and they'll be boating around
sd,"and they'll hit a, they'll hit a school of perches in the middle "
b,uh-huh
sd," and when they do, you can just drop the lines in and just pull them in one at, -"
sd,"they, they just drop it in"
sd,they can't pull it in fast enough
qw,"what do you, what do you catch perch on?"
%,"uh, i, they actually, they, -"
sd,"according to them, you can catch, when the perch are running, you can catch them on just about anything"
b,huh
sd,"they tend to use, i guess worms or some kind of lures sometimes,"
sd,"but, you know, i've, -"
sd,"she told me that they will sometimes use corn or anything, you know"
b,uh-huh
%,"they'll, -"
sd,"corn or salami or bread or anything,"
sd,"they'll, they'll, they'll hit because they're just sort of surrounded, these large schools"
b,"yeah,"
%,"it's, -"
sd,"sometimes i use corn,"
sd,"but, uh, uh, some fish steal it off the hook sometimes"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,it's a big problem
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"uh, the other day i was fishing with bread, uh,"
sd,there's a college across the street 
b,yeah
%," and they, -"
sd,"it's, it's full of carp and, uh, i caught a carp on a, about, what size is that, uh, i think it was a number two treble hook,"
b, um 
sd," and it's huge,"
sd,"its, its mouth was full of hooks"
ba,wow
sd,so he was in a bad way
%,"but, uh, it's, -"
sd,he was fast
%,"he, -"
qy,a big one?
ny,yeah
sd,"well, it's, uh, it was sixteen inches long"
ba,"wow, that's, that's, that's a nice size carp"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i think it was about a pound and a half, you know,"
sv,but all they're good for is the fight
sv,"boy they d-, they really don't want to come out of the water"
sd,"they,"
sd,"you're, how your line goes, you know -"
b,uh-huh
sd," and i thought, you know, that, uh, i wasn't going to be able to get it in, because, uh, the one i hooked just about ten minutes before, when i tried to raise it out of the water, it fell off,"
sd,so it wasn't hooked very well
sd,"but, you know, i got it that far,"
%,"i figured that, uh, -"
bf," that, that, that counts "
aa," yeah,"
sd,that's what i said
sd,that's what i told the guy
sd,the guy was standing there
sd,and he laughed when it fell off
sd,"and i said, that's a quick release, right there"
qy," do you, do you, do you actually like the taste of f-,"
qy,"do you, like, eat the fish that you catch"
qy,or are you more of a sport fisherman?
sd,"uh, catfish, yeah"
sd,"but, uh, i haven't eaten anything else, you know"
%,"uh, there's some, uh, -"
sd,my dad has a farm
%,"and there's, -"
sd,he has two ponds up there
sd,"and my uncle has a, a pond upstream"
sd,and there's a lot of crappie in there now
sd,"but, uh, i think he's the only one that's, that's caught enough crappie or, a big enough crappie to eat"
sd,"but the catfish, there's, you know, there's hundreds of them from like two to six pounds and, that,"
ny,yeah 
b," right,"
%,"so you can just, oh, -"
sd,because i don't actually like fish
%,"it's sort of, -"
sd,"so when i fish, it's more for sport than anything else"
b,"yeah,"
%,"and if, you know, -"
sv,"when you, when you have to look in their eyes and, you know, hit them in the head or whatever, that's what you do with a catfish "
aa,right
sv,"and, and, and, and, and be careful you don't get stung"
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
aa,"yeah,"
sd,i know it
qy,"have you ever tried, uh, deep sea fishing?"
ng,"uh, not yet"
sd,"my brother went off the coast of maine, uh,"
%,"when the, -"
h,"i don't know,"
%,"what they, -"
%,mackerel -
b,yeah
qy, that school up there? *listen--is there overlap?
%,it's -
sd,"he, he said that it was just like that"
sd,"they were throwing like, uh, uh, hell benders or, uh, uh, some other kind of treble hook lure"
sd,"and, and, uh, each time they bring them in they'd have at least one,"
sd,"sometimes they've had two on, you know, one on every hook"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"we, i was out in florida with a friend a while ago"
sd,"and we would go and just, uh, drop two, you know, a, a two or three rig, two or three hooked rig as well down off a boat"
sd,we just dropped it down there
sd,"and, the captain had, you know, some kind of sonar in the boat "
b,uh-huh
sd, so he'd maneuver us into a school of fish
sd,"and you just drop it in and and it just, -"
sd,"you, you get one or two at a shot, you know"
sv,"and,"
b,yeah
sd,"it was, it was a, like twenty dollars for six hours of fishing on some big charter boat"
ba,wow
sd,"you know, and, and, and they'll clean your fish on a tip basis for you if you want"
b,"yeah,"
sd,down here it's like two hundred dollars a day
%,"well, this is, -"
%,"yeah,"
sd,"this, this, this was for a, you know, large, -"
sd,there were 
bf,a group party
sd,"we, we weren't all related, just, you know, thirty people off the shop in the boat there"
b,yeah
sd,"if you want to go on a boat alone, it's like two hundred dollars a day"
b,yeah
sd,"but this is great, because it was, i think it was nineteen dollars for five hours and twenty dollars for six hours or something"
b,uh-huh
%,"you know,"
sd,"so you'd get to go out there for, five-, for, for six hours and get a nice suntan and bring along some lunch and, and fish all day"
sv,it's really nice < >
sv,it's real enjoyable
b,yeah
sd,"well, i, i don't know if it's been five minutes yet or not"
sv,"i think we're probably close, though"
aa,yeah
fc,it's nice talking to you
fc,"nice talking to you, too"
fc,good luck with fishing this season
fc,good luck
fc,bye-bye
fc,bye-bye
sd,i'm actually at work
b,"oh, o-, -"
%,"i-, -"
sd,"i'm in facilities and happen to have, uh, weekend duty here"
bk,"oh, okay"
qw,what building do you work in?
sd,i'm in the south building
bk,"oh, okay"
bk,okay
sd,"we, we pull mostly evenings"
sd,"we are having, -"
sd,"there's three of us, uh, facilities' managers are covering the off shifts just to have somebody here, uh, from management to, uh, see if they need anything"
bk,"oh, okay"
bk,okay
%,"oh, the, -"
qw,how many calls have you made?
sd,i've only made a few
bk,okay
%,"um,"
sd,"i'm, uh, getting close to twenty"
%,"this is the, -"
sd,"yeah, hopefully you have a lot to talk about in this one,"
sd,but i don't really have a lot in this one
sd,usually i can talk for hours on most of the subjects they pick 
ad,"go ahead, you first "
aa,"okay,"
sd,our topic for today is invasion of privacy
sd,"so, i got a good one"
b,"okay,"
ba,good
sd,"when the phone rings and you've got a recording, and this always happens like around five or six o'clock,"
b," okay, yeah "
sd,and then it won't go away
sd,"and any, any of the type of solicitation that, where they call all the time, you know"
sd,"there are evenings especially friday nights, thursday and friday nights"
sd,"well, we must get in the neighborhood of anywhere from three to six calls about that time of night"
sd,"more people call, that's where you want to jerk the phone out of the wall, you know, your sitting down to eat and the phone rings"
sd,"and,"
aa, right 
aa,"yeah,"
%,"i, -"
sd,"the worst one, i guess, is like you, when it's a recording i thin-, i don't mind so much someone calls"
sd,"and it's a, and it's a salesperson, at least you can chat or whatever and say, okay, now, we want to go ,"
sd,"and then when, when they actually start off with a, a computer,"
b, uh-huh 
aa,uh-huh
aa,"oh, yeah"
^h,"uh, shut my other radio off here "
b,"yeah,"
sd,"that's, that's real irritating to me"
sd,"uh, i guess they get their name-, -"
sd,"i'm, i'm amazed the question about that the, -"
sd,my concern would be everyone seems to have an answering machine
sd,"and i have one too,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and they say that they can tie up your answering machine and just have a big long, if they catch your answering machine,"
bf,they can leave their whole spiel on it
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"they, they can erase all your others, you know, because if you have, -"
sd,"i think that's the way it is, no, mine, i guess, if it's full, it will not take it, i'm not sure"
sd,"but they can certainly, uh, block your answering machine so someone else calls you, uh, and your answering machine is full, you know,"
b, huh 
b,yeah
%,"i, -"
aa,but your right *your you're
sv,that was a good one
aa," yeah,"
sd,"that's, that's a high irritant for me"
sd,drives me crazy
sd,and it doesn't matter if you have an unlisted number or not because a lot of times these computer things will just make up numbers at random and just call them
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so it really, really doesn't make much difference as to whether or not, you know, you have a unlisted number or not"
sd,"and they pass around, uh, cards that have everybody's name on it"
sd,"like if you order something through a mail order catalog,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"or they sell their catalog list of people,"
b, yeah 
sd,"but it's, uh, annoyance for me in the office with, uh, speaker phones"
%,"you know, i, -"
%,"the-, -"
sv,they're great for an office
sd,"but this one guy next to me, who's not here just so i could talk about him,"
sd,and it carries over
sd,"and so not only would you hear, -"
sv,"it seems to me that you talk longer from wh-, you kind of yell into it"
aa,right
aa,right
sd,"uh, and so he yells into it,"
sd,"and you hear the other person too,"
sd,so it's kind of a double annoyance
sd,"he actually, uh, ruins my privacy you might say because the, the t i offices are so open anyway"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i don't know whether that's an invasion of privacy just being loud and, and annoying, you know"
sd,"uh, that's,"
b, uh-huh 
sv,"but i think it is,"
%,"and yo-, -"
sd,we both picked phone items there
aa,"oh, yeah"
aa,"oh, yeah"
^h,"let's see, i'm trying to think"
qy,"oh, have you heard that, that, i'm trying to think of what company it was, there was a company that was going to, uh, be giving out information about your financial status"
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd," i heard something about, not that exactly,"
ad,but go ahead
sd,"well, um, i work in the computer science center"
sd,"and so we hear a lot about things that are, that computers are capable of doing"
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, this was a software program that a company was developing that was going to have x amount of million peoples financial history and information on it"
sd,"and they were going to sell it to companies who would up in turn solicit you for business et cetera, et cetera"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, they finally, uh, stopped production of it because of all the hullabaloo it caused,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,and i wouldn't have been too thrilled about it either
sd,"i mean, there was a lot of stuff going on about it"
sd,"well, i, uh, heard something similar to that"
sd,"i listen to, -"
sd,"i'm a, uh, uh, talk show person"
%,"and there was, -"
b, okay 
sd," when i, when i do my chores up at the rad-, -"
sd,i'm a radio person i guess is what i mean
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so i listened to, was it five seventy, which has continuous talk on the weekends,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"and, uh, i don't know if it was a lawyer or whatever it was talking about when you make out a fin-, a financial application, all that information on there is really not necessarily, -"
sd,"even a, your social security number, you know, they,"
b, huh 
b,uh-huh
sd,whether it's your personal salary or whatever
sd,"uh, if your just making out a credit card application you don't need to put down"
sd,"and i was curious as to w-, you know, what specific things you, you did have to put down"
b,huh
sd,"but he says social security, you don't need to put that down there which i thought was surprising"
sd,"so maybe there's something along that same line where, you know, in all these financial, uh, applications that you make out, you don't have to put all that stuff down there"
sd,"it would be nice to know what's, what was, -"
sd,"of course, of course, they could say, well, i can't give you a card,"
sd,"and you could say, fine,"
sd,"but, you know, some things will be private, you know,"
sd,but he said just put n a
sd,"and he said usually you'll get approved anyway because they just want your money , they want your card"
sd,"but if you don't feel like putting it down, just put n a, you know"
b,uh-huh
ba,"well, that's real interesting"
sd,"i know that a lot of times they ask for information that they don't really need,"
b," yeah,"
b,yeah 
sd,and there it is
sd,that's all they really care about
b,yeah
sd,they just want that credit history to see if you're a person
sd,if you're going to go ahead and pay your bills on time and things like that
sd,"i haven't, -"
sd,"i don't have any friends down at the, the austin plant,"
sd,"but i heard that they were really upset about the drug thing,"
sd,and we seem to up here have just breezed through that
sd,and apparently some other companies are having trouble
sd,"that, i don't have any trouble with it"
sd,"uh, it's kind of unusual here we are in dallas, you know, the biggest location and, and it just breezed through"
sd,"and wasn't really, no one was, i guess, was really too concerned about it, uh, yet in austin, there, there were, whether it was a class action or how far it got, i don't really know because t i only had a few things on t i news i think about it,"
b, uh-huh 
%,"but the, -"
sd,"some people object to that which i don't mind, no problem at all, you know"
sd,"oh, i know that there's several people i've talked to that really have a problem with it"
sd,"and,"
b, huh 
sd,"so you get kind of used to,"
b," yeah,"
b,right 
sd,"you know, you don't pay any attention to it i mean,"
b, right 
sd," once you sign over your soul to uncle sam,"
aa, i know 
%,"but , -"
aa,"i know, yeah"
sd,"i served my time too, yeah"
sd,"so, i think, i think the people who have, who have been down that route or have had it, to deal with anything like that have learned, you know, it's just one of those things"
sd,you just do it and be done with it and don't worry about it
b,yeah
sd,but i do know that there are several sites 
%,"i didn't, -"
sd,"i wasn't aware that austin was one of them,"
sd,but i think johnson city was one
qy,"oh, did they object too?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"there's, there's several of the cities that have been having real trouble with the issue"
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sd,"well, i'm, i'm all for it"
%,"i, -"
sd,"uh, it doesn't bother me that whether they do it in high schools or, you know, carry it to wherever you want to carry it really, uh,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"but, uh, i'm saying certainly at work i have no problem with it"
sd,"uh, uh, and i think it is, they, they found that it's been very low really"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i guess maybe at the locations though, i don't know if they have it done but, done it by location"
sv,"i don't really know if, uh, they need to publish that really"
sv,"oh, i don't think it's a necessary thing to publish it they just need to deal with it and, , on an individual basis"
aa,right
sv,"i mean,"
aa, right 
aa, right 
sv,"but i think that was an actu-, actually a good thing that happened, uh, i never considered it, i guess, it's an invasion of your privacy"
sv,"but it's something that is for the good of so many people, you know, to,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"and, uh, and hopefully, maybe some people will convince other people that are on drugs that, well, uh, i might as well get off, you know, if i want to stay so, you know,"
sv," oh, i, "
aa," oh, sure "
sd,"and i can just imagine if, you know, , you know, some guy being on drugs they go there"
sd,"and,"
b, right 
sd,"and they fall, they fall out because of the drug issue,"
b, uh-huh 
sv,"but the use of drugs or anything like that,"
b, right 
sd,"this is, this is a tough one, i don't, really haven't thought about any of this"
sd,"they had gardening yesterday and all the repairs,"
%,"and, boy, i could, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","pretty good,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",pretty good
qy,"so we're talking about drug testing in the work place, huh *listen"
b^m,drug testing in the work place
sd,"um i've been tested a few times, just before pre-, drug employment"
sd,but that's about it
sd,i've never had random drug testing
b,"yeah,"
sd,"we have random drug testing at, in my business,"
sd,"but i've never been, uh, never had to do it"
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"they started that about a year ago,"
sv,"and i think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time,"
%, at least that's -
qy^d," oh, they do with alcohol "
br,pardon?
qy,they do it with alcohol?
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"they, they, they'll check for alcohol"
sv,"oh, i thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine"
ar,"no,"
sd,"once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing"
ba,huh that's interesting
b,"yeah,"
%,"it's a, -"
qw,what type of field of work are you in?
sd,i'm in the oil business
b^m,"oh, in the oil business"
aa,yeah
bk,"okay,"
qy^d,and you work in the office around
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i work in the office,"
sv,"so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"see, i work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags "
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and we work around a lot of explosives
sv," well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on"
b,"yeah,"
%,"so that's, you know, -"
sd,"i'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment i work in, you know, they're working with explosives,"
sv,"and so they could blow up the whole, -"
sd,"well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use,"
sv,"but still, it can be dangerous"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"well, i, i, i agree"
sv,"i think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff"
b,yeah
%,"you know,"
%,"if it's, -"
sd,"as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know, -"
sd,"as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, i don't have that big a problem with it"
qy,"now do they fire them, or do they? -"
^h,"well, see, this is it,"
sd,this is where i start having my problems with my company
sd,"i work for a private company,"
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"but if they catch you, if you test positive for a, a controlled substance, then you get fired"
ba,"oh, wow"
sv,"so, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos"
%,"huh, that's -"
sv,"i think our policy is that, -"
sv,"all right, it's probably the same thing"
h,"i'm not really sure what the , -"
b,"yeah,"
b,"really,"
sv,"it's one of those things that you read once,"
sv,"and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it "
aa, that's right
sd,"but i know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance,"
sd,but i'm not sure if 
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,our company's a little tougher on the second chance
sv,"i mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, i think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply"
qy,"uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits, -"
no,"well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody i work around is in an office environment"
%,"and, you know, it's not, -"
sd,"i guess i ha-, haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, so i gue-, you know, i guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery,"
sd,"i mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked"
b,uh-huh
sv,"so, uh, i'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the a -s and b -s are going to be in"
sd,"and next week,"
sv,you could time it just right
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"right,"
aa,right
sd,"i know one employee,"
sd,"i know, when i was working with, he had alcohol on his breath,"
sd,and i'm not sure if our policy covers that or not
sv,that'd be just as dangerous
aa,yeah
sv,"well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff"
aa,huh that's true
sd,"you know, i've, i've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case "
b,uh-huh
qy,"do they give any limits on alcohol,"
qrr,or is it? -
no,"uh, i don't remember, to tell you the truth"
sv,i don't think they do
sv,"um, well, they must,"
ba,"i mean, gee whiz"
sd,"that just shows you how much i've been paying attention,"
sd,"because i, i really don't know"
sd,i'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask 
b, oh
sv,"well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far"
sd,"uh, there was a company in houston that,"
sd,"they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company "
b,uh-huh
sd," oh, it was, it was, it was an unannounced sweep of, of, -"
sd,"it was not only drugs, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",set
b,okay
qy,"you, you got the topic, right?"
ny,yeah
b,okay
qw,"uh, well, where in dallas are you?"
sd,i'm in richardson
bk,"oh, okay"
qy,"so you do re-, do recycling there?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"richardson has, uh, well, they have a newspaper pick up once a week supposedly, if it's not raining"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and they also have a couple of areas where you can take, uh, cans, plastic and paper, to, uh, you know, dump them off there if you don't, uh, want to wait and have a pick up, least of paper,"
sd,but they don't pick up the other items
sd,they don't pick up cans or the 
b,uh-huh
qy,"are they going to later,"
qy,do you know?
no,i'm not sure
sd,"they only started to do the newspaper , uh, late last year"
sd,just kind of like a trial basis
b,uh-huh
%,um
qo,what about you?
sd,"well, i'm, i'm in dallas proper "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i know they do have, you know, a pilot program going on"
sd,but it's not here
%,um
sd,so they're not picking up anything 
b,oh
sd,"so, i mean, we, we collect everything "
sd,"we've got all these boxes in our garage for, you know, green glass and clear glass and plastic and everything"
qw,where do you take them?
sd,"well, there's, there's a couple places"
sd,"unfortunately, we can't find a place that will take everything"
%,um
sd,"uh, there's a lot of places to take, like the plastic, uh, shopping bags "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,and there's a wal-mart nearby that takes almost everything
sd,i can't remember what it is they don't take
%,um
sd,and the library will take glass
sd,"so we end up, you know, -"
sd,on the weekend we pack it all in the car
sd,"and,"
%,um
sd,"drop things off one at a time,"
sd,"but, uh, and it's kind of disappointing, i mean,"
sd,"i would even be happy if they just had one, you know, one place where you could do everything"
sd,"you know, it would still be more convenient than what we have now"
sd,"one of the people from my department, i think used to take a lot of the stuff to a recycling center that was for the benefit of the dallas shelter"
%,um
sd,i think it was 
qw,where is that?
sd,"uh, she's not here anymore "
b,oh
%," but, uh, yeah,"
sd,i'm pretty far north
sd,"i'm not, i'm, i'm, i'm just, i'm north of addison actually"
b,oh
sd,"so i'm, i'm really -"
b,yeah
sd," i'm, s-, i'm in dallas, but only technically "
sd,"well, sometimes we take our, uh, we always keep our aluminum cans"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,and a lot of times they take them over to one of these can banks
b,"yeah,"
sd,i've seen those
sd,you don't get too much money back
sd,i figure it pays for the gas to take my cans over there
b,yeah
sd,"but normally i collect, oh, like three trash bags full "
b,yeah
sd, and i take them over to that can bank
sd,"and it's more fun just to kind of like crunch the cans ,"
sd,don't get too much money for them
%,"but, -"
sv,"well, you get something "
%,"uh,"
b,yeah
sd,"we used to do that,"
sd,"but, again, that's another stop "
b,uh-huh
sd," and it doesn't take plastic bags and, and all that sort of thing,"
sd,"but, uh, i think that, you know, i heard that it was going well in the pilot area wherever that is"
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
sd,that would be good because we have two trash pick ups a week 
b,uh-huh
sd," and, where i grew up we only had one a week"
sd,and that was certainly sufficient
sd,"so if they just do, -"
sd,one of them will be trash
sd,"and the alternate time would be recyclables,"
sd,that would be great
b,yeah
%,"so, -"
b,yeah
sd,"uh, i'm disappointed sometimes they're not always consistent in picking up those papers, you know"
sd,i seem to put them out there 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and like sometimes they come by,"
sd,sometimes they don't
b,oh
sd,i'm not really sure why they're not always consistent in that
%,um
sd,"but i could certainly have, uh, three bins out there for, you know, plastic and "
b,right
sd,that would be easy
b,yeah
qy,"do you have to, uh, sort the paper and take out the glossy pages and that, that sort of thing"
qrr,or do they take the whole thing?
sd,"you're not supposed to have, like the coupons in there"
bk,"oh, okay"
sd,"uh, or you're not supposed to put magazines in there "
b,uh-huh
sd, and you can't take newspapers
sd,"now at work, uh, you know, we have changed our recycling"
sd,at first they were kind of finicky about what kind of paper you could recycle
sd,"and not too long ago they finally decided if it's anything that's paper and tears, you can throw it in there because at first "
oo_co_cc,let me guess 
sd," you work at t i,"
^g,right?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"at first they said,"
sd, so do i
b,yeah
sv,"you know, well, that's stupid"
sd,and then they 
%,um
sd,"well, in the, my department everybody gets the wall street journal"
b,yeah
sd,there was like a lot of paper coming out of our department that wasn't recyclable
b,yeah
sd,"so i thought that was pretty good to expand upon it,"
%,"say, -"
sd,"well, and they take cans, now, too"
b,yeah
sd,i still put my cans in with the cans
sd,"i mean, i don't want it with paper"
sd,somehow that just seems weird to me 
sd," well, our department used to collect the cans anyway for the christmas tree project"
sd,"and,"
b,oh
ba,ooh
sd,and it worked out really well
sd,"well, we had the one person who used to take things to the dallas shelter"
b,uh-huh
sd,i think that's what that was called
b,uh-huh
sd,"she collected, she used to collect from the whole department,"
sd,but she took them all down to that dallas shelter place
b,uh-huh
sd,"i wish i could remember the whole name of that place,"
sd,but it's a charity for the benefit of this shelter
b,uh-huh
%,"and, yeah,"
sd,"she, u-, she used to collect them from everybody in the department"
b,yeah
sd,she'd go up and down with her little bag 
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"because we would get it, -"
sd,"uh, i guess, uh, i've always been kind of interested in, in, space and stuff"
sd,"i've,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
qy,"have you been following the, uh, the progress of the space health code ?"
na,"uh, to a degree"
sd,"i haven't kept up as, uh, much as i would like,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i've just been so busy, uh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i barely get a chance to read a newspaper now and then,"
%,so -
b,yeah
sv,"i think it's pretty exciting that they can, uh, -"
sv,"it would be interesting to see if they can find, uh, other planets that are, that will be more habitable to, uh, you know, uh, humans"
%,"and, uh, yeah,"
sd,"i think i would be very interested in space travel in the future if, uh, if it, you know, if it is at all possible"
b,yeah
sd,"well, i wouldn't even mind, uh, being a pilot on one,"
%,or right now -
sv,but i'm probably getting a little too old for that
sv," well, i know if they make the advances that they have been making, that, uh, maybe age will no longer, age or even physical, uh, abilities may not be, uh, a barrier anymore"
aa,right
aa,yeah
sv,"well, they, they just made leaps and jumps"
sv,"i think a lot of our, our technology we have is, is quite a bit due to lot of the space travel, uh, uh, equipment and stuff that, -"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"i agree uh,"
sd,"as a matter of fact we're the ones that i have been to houston to, to, you know, to visit the, uh, space center out there,"
sd,"and, uh, one of the big advances that we use every day now is velcro "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, that vacuum , uh, little space program was one of the big, you know, backers of that"
b,yeah
sv,"it's amazing, you know,"
%,"you, -"
sv,it's hard to imagine what life was like without it now
b,yeah
qy^d,"i don't know if you ever watch gallagher , you know,"
sd,he's one of the comedians
sd,and 
ny,"uh-huh,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i've h-, seen him before"
qh,"wh-, i-, what would we do without it? "
b,yeah
sd,"yo-, we were talking about that just the other day"
qh,what did we do without it back then?
b,yeah
sv,i guess there was a lot of buttons and a lot of zippers and snaps
b, yeah
b,"yeah,"
sv,"there's, there's a lot of, a lot of little things that have come up "
%,"i know maybe some of the big things that, uh, uh, -"
sd,concentrated foods for one maybe 
h,"i don-,"
aa, that's right
aa,that's right
qh,"it's also just i've, i've often pictured, uh, in my mind, you know, what it would be like to just, what would you find if you just kept on going, kept on going?"
aa,uh-huh
aa,that's true
sv,"uh, i guess our minds are so, uh, uh, what is it? uh, finite "
b,uh-huh
sv," when we try and picture the universe as an infinite object,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"i always thought well, what do you do hit a brick wall, eventually"
sv,it's hard to consider that something could go on indefinitely
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"that, that is, uh, that is something that would be hard to think about"
aa,i agree
aa,you know like you say we're used to finite things
sv,and something that is infinite and just incomprehensible -
aa,yeah
%,"but, -"
b,"but, uh, yeah,"
sd,"i would like to see them, uh, do more in that area to make space travel more, uh, something that the ordinary person can, uh, en-, enjoy"
aa,yeah
sv,i know it's i think it's in people's nature to be the first to do something
b, uh-huh 
sd,"and i, i'd love to be the first one to step on a planet or some like, you know, -"
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd,me too
sd,"i wouldn't even mind being not so much being first but just, uh, get out there and, and just explore"
b,yeah
sv,"i think, uh, it's in everyone's nature to some degree to want to get out and explore something they haven't,"
b,huh
sv,"i think that's what made us, uh, progress to the state we are is our curiosity"
aa,"oh, sure"
aa,sure
aa,of course
aa,that's true
sv,"there must be some better so-, better way of doing this"
sv,"a better place to be or whatever, you know"
%,"it's, -"
b,uh-huh
sv,"so you, you are always looking for something better"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,that's true
sd,"i know at work, uh, people always complain to me"
sd,"i, well, you are always whining"
sd,"and,"
b,yeah 
sv,there's a better way of doing it than what we are doing it
aa,that's right
aa,that's right
sv,"and if you are just content with being, you know, with the way things are then, you know, then you must lead, lead a pretty dull life"
b,yeah
%," because if yo-, -"
sv,"well, they are always finding easier ways"
sv,"and, you know, just because they don't talk about it or something like that -"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and they are doing it un-, you know, unconsciously"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"i guess, uh, you don't really think about it too much"
sv,i guess you are always finding newer ways and better ways of doing stuff
%,"but yo-, -"
sv,"it, it's in a subconscious, you know, thing"
sv,"you know, somewhere they can sit down and write down what, you know, things that you've improved upon,"
sv,you probably wouldn't have a pretty good list
b,uh-huh
sv,but you just don't think about them
b,right
aa, and that's true
%,"i think, uh, you know, -"
sd,"we've gotten different programs at work, you know, to, to, uh, make it visible to management that we are doing things better,"
qw,how many children do you have now?
sd,well i have five
br,you have five?
aa,right
qy,well you do have a hard time finding time then don't you? 
sd," well, five are, i mean four of them are grown,"
sd,they're in college or just out of college
sd,so i really have just a thirteen year old at home
b,uh-huh
sv,you sound so young
sd,"well, i work at it "
bk, all right <<very faint>>
%,"to have them, uh, -"
sd,i try to fool everybody 
sv, i think you're doing a good job
sd, i just have one child
b,uh-huh
%,"and, uh, i don't think, uh, -"
sd,well there's not much i can do about it
sd,"my, my wife and i are, u-, in our forties, you know,"
%,"so, uh -"
b,uh-huh
sv," but it's hard to raise one child without them thinking they're the, they're the pivot point of the universe"
aa,i think you are right
sd,because i was an only child too
sd,"and that's one reason i have so many because i really, i enjoy the big family"
b,yeah
sd,and my thirteen year old is pretty separate from her brother and sisters
sd,and so she is sort of like an only child
sv,"and it's the same type of thing, uh, "
b, uh-huh
sd, i have a younger brother like that
sd,"i'm in my forties, like i say"
sd,and i have a brother in his twenties
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i was, i was the youngest"
b,yeah
sd,so i understand how that worked
sd,and he was treated like he had five fathers or something 
aa, right
sd," that's exactly how it is, you know"
sd,she's got all these sisters and her brother to take care of her
sd,"when things don't go right, she just calls one of them, you know"
b,yeah
%,"but, uh, yeah,"
sd,"it, it's a little bit difficult, though"
sd,i think it was easier when they all had each other and could entertain each other and i was home more 
%,"and, -"
qy," did you all do a lot of organized things like, uh, little league, uh, soccer? "
ng," we, we really did not"
sd,my next oldest daughter that's in college in california is a world twirling champion
sd,she twirls a baton
sd,and we did a lot of things together
b,uh-huh
sd,"she and i did a lot of things together and flew, -"
sd,we have flown all over the world for her to compete and to perform
b,uh-huh
sd,and that was a lot of fun
sv,"but that, that, i guess you could consider that organized"
sv,"i mean, there is a competition all the time"
b,yeah
sd,we were very heavy into that
sd,"other than that, they were pretty much, -"
sd,and maybe dancing school for a while or mainly school sports and things like that
sv,"you know, i think that's probably true the, -"
sv,"if you have one child or fewer, you get involved in organized events or "
b,uh-huh
sv,"and if you have a large number of children or, then you don't"
sv,"well, you can't afford to"
aa,"no,"
%,"you ca-, -"
sv,"and there's not enough time, uh "
aa, right 
sd," like my son is in, uh, little league this year"
sd,he's ten
sd,and they practice three times a week
sd,and they have a game
sv,"and it's just, uh, if there were more than one child, i don't know, the-, there would be no way to do it"
aa,right
aa, that's right 
sv," you know, one parent go one direction"
sv,and i'd have to go in the other
sv,and 
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,well i know i spent hours in the gym every day with my daughter
sd,and my little one also competed because really she had no choice
sd,she had to go with me
b,uh-huh
sd,"so the three of us just spent a lot of time traveling and, and competing"
sv,"and, of course, the competing itself, really didn't matter what it was,"
sv,it was making the friends and going all the places
sd,"and it was a really neat experience,"
sd,but it took our total time
sd,"i did not work, uh, when i did this"
sd,now i do work full-time
b,uh-huh
sd,"and it's just,"
sd,and so we really have to keep it together to get just her activities in and still have time to spend with each other
%," so , -"
sv," i don't think, although i-, i-, -"
sv,"i think a, a, more than one child, probably three children is probably the ideal to me"
sv,but i'm not sure i could afford three
sv,i most certainly couldn't educate three
sd,"i don't know how my, my parents did it"
b,yeah
sd,"i mean, there were five of us"
sd,"and i don't recall, you know, wanting anything in particular"
sd,"uh, but i don't know how my father did it"
sd,he worked at a truck line
sd,and he just didn't make that kind of money with five children
sd,but we did okay
sd,"we had a house and a home and, -"
sd,"but now, my wife and i both work"
sd,"and we don't, i don't believe we have as much as my parents did"
sd,and we only have one child
bh,really?
b,uh-huh
sv,"well, things cost a lot more"
sd,i don't know how it is in georgia 
b,huh
sv, and i don't think our part of the country is particularly bad compared to some
sd,atlanta is horrible
qy,is it?
ny,yes
sd,"ha-, we have a lot of people moving here from boston and, and different areas"
sd,"and from talking to them, they're shocked"
bh,really?
%," wha-, -"
%,"and they, you know, -"
sd,the housing is so cheap 
b,right
aa, that's what i've heard 
sd,"they sell their house,"
sd,they stash away a good bit of money and come down here
sd,"and i work with a lot of them,"
sd,"they, they think they, they have really done something"
sd,"then when they get down here, they realize the cost of living is outrageous "
b,huh
b, yeah 
sd,"the housing is cheaper,"
sd,but that's about it
arp_nd,i'm surprised to hear that
sv,"i've heard very positive things about atlanta,"
fp,good morning
fp,hi
fp,my name is jean
fp,i'm tina
qw,"oh, where you from tina?"
sd,"i live in garland, texas"
bk,"oh, garland, texas,"
sd,i'm in pennsylvania
sd,"oh, my lands, you're the farthest person i've ever talked to"
bh,really? 
ny,yeah
qy,do you work for texas instruments?
ng,my husband does
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
qy,"probably most people you talk to do, huh?"
na,most of them do 
sd,"now, i don't have anybody that works for t i,"
sd,"but, uh "
b,huh
sd,i don't know what 
b,"i see,"
ba,well that's neat
sd,"so, i guess we're supposed to talk about foods today"
aa,"yeah,"
ad,"i guess you have to push one, though"

b,uh-huh
sd,"your, uh, bread family and your, -"
sd,"or least what it used to be the regular menu was followed and ,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, something from each, each area that you're supposed to choose from"
b,uh-huh

h,"i,"
b,oh really
sv,well maybe
h,"i guess,"
aa,"well, yeah,"

sv,"i think it's the texture of it,"
b,uh-huh
sv,but it takes more chewing 
aa,right
sv," children usually they like the ham and the hamburgers,"
b,uh-huh
sv,and it is easier to chew
aa,right
aa,right
sd,so they're not too much into beef
b,uh-huh

b,right
aa,that's right 
sd,"sometimes you have all desserts,"
sd,"sometimes,"
b,yeah 
b,"yeah,"
aa,"that's true, "
sv,"that's the only problem with just letting you bring whatever,"
b,yeah
sd,"but, it doesn't happen very often,"
sd,usually you get a pretty wide variety
sd," and you can, you can ,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
aa,yeah
sd,i remember one time we had a progressive dinner

b,uh-huh
sd,we were not sure who didn't show up with the food

aa,yes
sv,and you know they know better
b,right
sv,"even if they can't do it, they can always maybe get somebody else to cook "
aa,right
sv,"either, either go ahead and fix your dish"
sv,or call someone that can
aa,right
aa,right
b,i know it

%,"and so, uh, several, -"
sd,"i, i, think, maybe, uh, four summers in a row, uh, we spent, uh, our vacation time in the summer, uh, four wheeling through, uh, portions of, uh, the southern half of colorado"
sd,"and, and, uh, every time, uh, my mother had, uh, uh, -"
sd,i have two other sisters
sd,"and my mother had us, uh, do some studying of the, the, area which we going to visit"

sd, uh 
b, uh-huh 
sd,"uh, my fiancee is a very very good photographer"
sd,that is what she had originally gone to school to do was photography 
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, i, i, am close to receiving my english degree, uh, as, as, well as my, my, graduate degree,"
sd,"so, so, i, uh, uh, we have thought very seriously of trying to, uh, incorporate travel into and writing a book about, uh, some portion of travel, uh,"
sd,"so we are hoping soon, uh, not soon, maybe within the next ten years to get to, to take a trip over from, uh, over to europe and take, uh, a trip from the northern portion of france "
b,uh-huh
sd,"it is kind of a backward s shape, uh, trail that the pilgrims use to take, uh, in, in, uh, back in the medieval times, uh, to see the relics, uh, in, uh, southern spain "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so we would like to take pictures of the gothic and romanesque monasteries and, uh, just take that journey all the way down "
b,right
sd, that would be quite a project
aa,"yeah,"
sd,it would be 
b,yeah
sd," uh, it, it is our big dream"
sv,"well, it would be a lot fun"
sv,"you know, there is good and there is bad"
sd,and my experience in italy was not my favorite for sure
sd,"but,"
%,"oh, su-, uh, -"
bh,really?
b,uh-huh
sd,"my daughter is, uh, a twirling champion "
b,uh-huh
sd," and she had to perform over there and, in turin"
sd,and so we had to fly into milan
sd,"and we got on the subway after so much trouble because the italians, even if they speak english, they do not want to let you know "
ba,"oh, sure"
sd, and they gave us all the wrong directions 
b, oh
sd, and there were just two of us
sd,at the airport they put us on the wrong bus 
sd,"finally, we saw a policeman"
sd,he put us on the subway
b,uh-huh
sd,"we sat there, uh,"
sd,we did not know italian
sd,we looked at each other
sd,we said things like spaghetti < >
b, uh-huh
sd,we finally followed some kids who told us where to get off
sd,"we followed these kids with, uh, gym bags"
sd,and we figured that must be the sports arena 
b,uh-huh
sd, and we lucked out
sd,and then when we needed to go to the bathroom there was nothing but a whole in the ground
sd,"i mean it was so,"
b,wow
sd,"but, that was our experience"
sv,and i guess all of italy is not like that
b,right
sd,"but where we were, it certainly was"
sd,"and the hotel that we stayed in, -"
sd,"we stayed with our english friends, their team in the hotel"
sd,and it was beautiful
sd,it was very modern
b,uh-huh
sd,but it was very far away on a bus
b,oh
sd,"so, you know, it was, it was really, uh, it was interesting"
sd,you always learn something
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sv,and you always have a fun experience
sv,so it is great you know
qy^d,you said that you have been to england several times?
ny,uh-huh
qy^d,"i wonder, have you ever been to a, uh, a small town, uh, -"
sd,well it is actually about thirty minutes from salisbury
sd,"it is called, uh, bemerton?"
nn,"no,"
sd,i have not huh-uh
b,okay
sd,"our friends live like an hour outside of england, like ash, around there"
b,"oh, okay"
b," alright,"
b,yeah 
%," so, uh-huh "
sd,"uh, uh, the reason i am curious, i, uh, -"
sd,"the other place i would like to visit, uh, -"
qy,do you want to tell me about your budgeting plan?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,our budgeting plan includes me getting a job 
sd,"we're, we're at the point now,"
sd,"i go-, i quit working about six months ago to start this house "
b,uh-huh
sd, and i'm out of cash
sd,and i'm not out of project yet
ba,"oh, no"
sd,"so, uh, i'm going to go back and do some consulting work"
sd,"as far as budget's concerned, i'm, i'm fairly fortunate"
sd,"uh, we've, we're right now where if we don't buy anything extra, we can make it on what my wife makes"
sd,"so, you know, the project's kind of halted until then"
sd,"but as far as budgeting is concerned, you know, we have, uh, some pretty strict guidelines that we go for, you know,"
sd,"we always put ten percent back,"
sd,and that's a never touch
bf,"uh, into savings"
aa,yeah
b,oh
sd,"either savings or investment, one of the two,"
sd,but we don't ever put it in a high risk
sd,it's just always going to be there
ba,"well, that's pretty good"
sv,"and as far as the rest of it's concerned, we don't have any kind of, uh, what i would call extravagant expenses, you know,"
sd,"we, uh, we pretty much live on about eight, nine hundred a month, you know, just travel to and from work and clothing and food "
ba,"boy, that's pretty good"
sd," and the rest of it, you know, we pile into the house"
sv,"and, uh, you know, i'm fairly fortunate"
sd,"i mean, our credit cards are out to the max right now because i'm "
b,sure
sd,"but, uh, we're still making the payments on them"
sd,"it's just, when you, -"
sd,see in texas you cannot borrow the money to build your own home 
b," yeah, "
sd," it's, it's tough here too"
sd,you have to have the contractor sign with you
aa,"right,"
aa,exactly
sv,but it's easy to find a contractor for a couple of hundred bucks who'll sign it and let you do it 
b,yeah
sd," , where i live, that is -"
sd,"and where i live, it, it's pretty scary, because texas is one of those strange states where if you have a contractor sign on your note like that "
b,uh-huh
sd,the bank can eat the contractor
bf,"oh, bad for him, huh"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,bad for him
sd,"but, the homeowner can't be touched"
%, um 
sd, it's a homestead state
qy,is that right?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"see right now if i quit paying any of my bills,"
sd,the only thing they could do is cut off electricity
sd,they can't take your land unless you don't pay your land taxes period
ba,wow
sd,"you know they can take your car and your clothes and your, anything"
sd,"that's not the tools of your trade,"
sv,"but as far as, uh, you know , you're pretty much bullet proof in this state"
sv,"well, that's kind of handy"
b,yeah
sd,i just finished james michener's texas book
b,uh-huh
sv,pretty interesting
b,uh-huh
sv,texas has quite the history
sd,"well, you know, we're, we're not ones to budget much, you know "
sd,we just going to spend it all
sd, that's kind of what we do
sd,"we, uh, we're l d s"
sd,and so we pay ten percent 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd," and then, you know, we put i guess it's like fifteen to twenty percent into a savings account"
b,uh-huh
sd,but that sometimes we use for emergency type things
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, and my wife doesn't work"
sv,"we're fortunate that way, that i make enough to do what we want to do"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"we're pretty, pretty fortunate as far as the, uh, the budgeting is concerned, because, you know, we don't have any long term debt"
sd,"you know, uh, we paid cash for car"
sd,"well, we bought the car on time, one of them,"
sd,"but we, you know, we since paid it off"
ba,well that's pretty
sd,"the land is paid for cash,"
sd,so we don't have to worry about that
ba,that's a great position to be in
sd,"well, it's fraught with other problems "
qy,is that right?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i'm not very motivated 
b,oh 
qw,what kind of consulting do you do?
sd,"uh, systems consulting computerization for construction firms"
bh,is that right?
ny,yeah

ad,don't get me to lying
sd,i bought it at a fire sale
b,oh
sd,"this guy's place burned down,"
sd,"and he had a bunch of computer stuff,"
sd,"and, you know, i bought it all"
sd,it was two hundred bucks for everything he had
ba,you got a buy
sd,"well, some of it wasn't worth anything, you know"
b,sure
sd,"you know, a lot of the, uh, diskettes were just totally unusable"
bf,"melted, or just wet"
%,"or, -"
aa," well, yeah"
sd," , or wet "
b,okay
sd,"but i did get out of there with, uh, vermont views, which is a huge, -"
qy^d,"say you did, uh, starters and bendix springs such as that on an old one"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"and, uh, helped my wife replace some carburetors"
b,yeah
sd,"some that, she had to, uh, label everything "
qy^d,she had to label everything
ny,yeah
%,"because, -"
qw,what was she driving?
sd,it was a cadillac
b,uh-huh
sd,"and they, uh, well, they quit making those, the quieter jet carburetor"
sd,and they quit making it
b,yeah
sd, they rebuilt it
sd,"and it never did, never did run right again"
b,"yeah,"
sd, quad not really easy to get rebuilt just right
b,yeah
qw,"uh, and like, what were you replacing the starters and bendix on?"
sd,"uh, a maverick and also, uh, a chrysler station wagon before that"
b,yeah
qy,"did you replace just the, uh, bendix on the chrysler station wagon or the whole starter?"
%,"uh, the, -"
sd,"i'm replacing the, two or three starters on the chrysler"
b,yeah
%,"they, -"
sd,the starters are kind of fragile
b,yeah
%,"and the, -"
sd,especially if you need a tune-up
b,uh-huh
sd,"they kept saying that the chrys-, that's what chryslers did, is they wore out starters"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"well, i-, i-, if they start real easy, you know, you just hit the key"
sd,and it starts up 
b,yeah
sd," and when it's properly tuned up, that starter will last for a long time"
b,uh-huh
sd,"see, they built that starter so it would fit every v eight and all the slant sixes that they've built in like thirty-five years"
b,right
sd,they all take the exact same starter
sd,they'll interchange completely
sd,i mean completely
sd,one starter will fit all of them
sd,"so they've got a whole lot of torque,"
sd,"but to do that, they did it,"
sd,"use an underdrive system, -"
sd,but they geared it down so the motor spins really fast 
b,uh-huh
sd,it's kind of tough on the bushings
b,yeah
sd,usually what goes is the bushings
b,right
sd,"you take a little time, replace the bushings, you still got a perfectly good starter"
sd,"but, uh, most places don't put, don't rebuild them with, with g-, with good enough bushings"
b,uh-huh
%,"so it's, you know, -"
sd,"after you get rebuilt one, you have a tendency to go through them pretty quickly, especially if you need a tune-up"
b,yeah
qw,"anyway, what are you driving now?"
sd,"uh, my chrysler van"
sd,"and it's, it's pretty maintenance free, you know,"
sd,"and, uh, at the beginning of the year last year and drove a chevrolet cavalier station wagon"

sd,it took me a while to get used to a four cylinder engine
b,yeah
sd,"you have to kind of wait for it, especially when you get on the highway"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"right now, without getting some of the sportier models, uh, the four cylinders aren't real peppy"
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, they're starting to change that out in the last couple of years, too"

sd,it got about seventeen
ba,"oh, wow"
sd,"well, till you got crazy with it"
sd,"you know, you get the four barrel all worked up"
sd,"and suddenly it, it, it drops off fast,"
sd,but 
b,yeah
sd,didn't have to work too hard to move the car around
qy,"now, do you think since they started with electronic ignition that it improves the way the car runs?"

sd,"it's big enough for us, though"
b, uh-huh 
sd, we kind of need maybe one more room
sd,we've got two children
b,"uh-huh,"
b,okay
qw,"so where do you live at, -"
qw^d,"i mean wha-, what part of town in here in denison"
b,"okay,"
%,"we-, -"
sd,"see, that's north"
qrr,"or down here in denison, -"
b,yeah
b,"okay,"
sd,"i live, i live in plano,"
sd,so it's north to me 
b,"okay,"
sd,up here then 
sd,"i say down,"
sd,i'm really from kentucky
sd,"i was going to say you didn't have the typical, -"
sv,"you have a southern accent,"
b, uh-huh 
sd, but you don't have a texas accent
b,right
sd,"well i'm originally from, uh, ohio, cincinnati,"
b," oh, okay "
sd," so i'm famili-, uh, familiar with, uh, -"
^2,"that area, -"
^2,that dialect -
aa,"right,"
aa,right
sd," also i lived in georgia for about four years,"
%,"so the, uh, -"
sd,"there's a difference too, between east and west, in the south"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"anyway, my home is, um, i guess it's about twenty-five hundred square foot"
sd,"and i have, uh, four bedrooms at the present"
sd,we're busting out walls and things like that
sd,that's what i want to do
qw,how many kids do you have?
sd,"we have two,"
sd,we have two
qy,"do you have enough bedroom space, then?"
ny," yeah,"
sd,"we'll have enough bedroom space,"
%,"it's, -"
sd,we're rearranging our house because the bedrooms are kind of small
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so, we're going to enlarge our master bedroom and take out a couple of walls and enlarge it and then shuffle the rooms around a little bit"
sd,that's kind of like what we'd like to do
sd,we just had a baby a couple months ago
sd,"and we've got a den,"
sd,it's more or less a spare room
b,uh-huh
sd,"we rarely go in there, except for to play chess"
b,uh-huh
sd,we want to make that a bedroom for my stepdaughter and my daughter
sd,"and, uh, we need the one extra room"
sd,"like, like you said, our rooms are too s-, the bedrooms are too small,"
sd,"the living room and kitchen are huge,"
b, right 
sd, but the bedrooms are too small
sd,"where you've got to leave the furniture just one certain way, you can't rearrange it at all"
b,"right,"
%,"there's they, uh, -"
sd,"i know what you're saying there,"
sd,ours is the same
sd,and they tend to put windows in the strangest places
b, yeah 
sd," you know we have windows in our bathrooms which really makes it difficult for, -"
b,"yeah,"
sd,we've got two great big windows in our back bathroom
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,"yo-, you're kind of limited in what you can do there and everything,"
%,so -
sd,no privacy
aa,"no,"
sd,"we don't have a lot of that,"
%,yeah
sd,"well, we've got at least two windows on every wall in the house"
%,"it, -"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i'd hate to clean these windows,"
sd,i really would
sd, i figured i'm going to have to hire somebody to remove our windows and put new ones in that are easier to clean
sd,ours are the double pane
sd,"and you can't really clean them on the inside, you know"
sd,"ours are those too,"
b,yeah
sd,you must live in an older home too then
aa,"right,"
sd,"i do,"
sd,"the house is about, um, i'd say almost thirty years old"
b, uh-huh 
sd," so it's not a new home,"
sd,"it's, it's seen some wear and tear"
sd,ours has too
sd,"when we moved in the man that sold it to us had said that he remodeled it,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and he did it hisself,"
sd,"so most of that, by now, is falling apart"
b, oh 
sd," you know, well i mean, it's not just horrible,"
sd,"but like this tile's come loose off the wall,"
sd,the whole bathroom is covered from ceiling to foot in tile
sd,and i don't like that at all
ba,"um, that is awful"
sd,"with that, uh, the great big tiles, square tiles like, that you put on the floor,"
b," uh-huh,"
qy,he did it in that? 
ny,"yeah,"
sd,instead of wallpaper
sd,"i wouldn't mind it if it was like short tiles,"
sd,"for that you put, -"
^2," the normal tiles,"
b,right 
aa, right
sd,"that you put around a bathtub,"
sd,that would be prettier
b, uh-huh 
sd, but this looks like floor covering on the wall
sd,it just doesn't look good
sd,"oh, and also they're very heavy"
sd,and so they tend to come off a whole lot easier
b,"right,"
sd,there's one big one that has come off
sd,"and short of putting nails through it, we can't get it back on,"
%,so -
b,um
sd,and he rewired the house
sd,"and it's shorting out here and there,"
%,and -
ba,"oh, wow,"
%,"i, -"
sd,"that's one of the things we've been fortunate with, is our, uh, wiring is okay"
sd,"we don't have a, we don't have enough power,"
sd,"um, or our breakers aren't, aren't powerful enough to take, to, to really help with the load in the house"
b, uh-huh 
sd," i mean we need to redo some, rewiring ourselves"
sd,but our plumbing is awful
sd,"there is n-, there is a shut off valve that's outside that doesn't work,"
b, um 
sd," and there's no other real shut off valves inside the house,"
sd,"so if something breaks, we have to shut it off from the main, in the street,"
b, yeah 
sd,"and, oh, it's, it can be really bizarre"
b,yeah
sd,and we never know where it's going to flood
sd,we've got power surges on the west side of our house
sd,we've got our stereo hooked up
b,uh-huh
%,"well that, -"
sd,the power makes it run
sd,"it's never ran,"
sd,"it's always ran just fine, the clock and stuff"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but it runs about ten minutes fast, except for about a month, for about a month the, the clock ran normal"
b,um
sd,"and then the power went off again,"
sd,lightning or something knocked it out
sd,and we hooked it back up
sd,and now it's running ten or fifteen minutes fast again
b,um
sd,but on the east side of the house it runs fine
ba,"oh boy, you do have a strange wiring problem there"
sd," he put new wiring in,"
sd,"it's all new wiring up in the attic,"
b, uh-huh 
b,uh-huh
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","but, uh, oh, no,"
sd,"he didn't know what he was doing,"
sd,he really should have hired people
ba,"well that's something, -"
sd,my husband's in construction
sd,and he won't even touch electrical stuff
%,"he, i-, -"
sd,"i mean, he'll do a little things"
sd,but he won't do any major rewiring
sd, he says he'd rather pay the electrician to handle it
b,"right,"
sv,he'll end up killing himself
br,pardon
sv,end up killing theirselves
ba,that's right
sd,"my husband, he'll change out a light switch,"
sd,but that's about as far as he'll go
sd,"well that's the way mine is, you know,"
b, yeah 
sd," i mean, he, he well he said he went up in the attic and looked around"
sd,"and he was like, oh my god,"
sd,"he says, looks like a bunch of spaghetti up there"
sd,"and we had squirrels in our attic when we first moved in because the roof was so sorry,"
%," uh, was a what, -"
sd,the roof was really sorry
sd,"i mean when we moved in,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"it was a wood shingle roof,"
%,"and we, -"
sd,"the first year we were living there, we had to replace the roof"
sd,"well he put, -"
%,which -
sd,i heard it's a law that you're only allowed to have three layers of shingles
sd,"is it three or five,"
sv,your husband probably knows
aa,"he probably knows,"
sd,i don't know what it is off hand
sd,"well, he's got seven layers of shingles up there,"
sd,and he told us it was a completely new roof
sd,"like i said, he didn't know what he was doing"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,he must not of
sd,"we stripped ours, we stripped ours off"
sd,"we didn't put it over, 'cause we put composition roof on"
sd,"and we completely s-, completely stripped all the old wood shingles off, put decking up, put the paper down, and i mean just started from scratch"
b,uh-huh
sd,unfortunately when we were doing that it decided it wanted to snow and hail and rain
ba,"oh, no"
sd,"and we, and we had, we had almost, i'd say about half of the roof off,"
sd,and it did this
^2,"and, uh, uh, a house full of snow"
sd,"and a house full of snow, and rain,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and it came down,"
sd,it did this in the middle of the night
sd,"we have plastic, you know, just tied down on everything, you know, as best we could,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,and the wind came in from the north
sd,and it just blew everything off in the middle of the night
sd,and we were asleep
sd,"and, and i woke up"
sd,and i got up
sd,and it was about four o'clock in the morning
sd,"and i heard all these, these drips, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip"
ba,"oh, no"
sd,i had water coming in every light fixture
%," that, -"
b,yeah 
sd," i had water coming in everything that was in the ceiling, everywhere"
sd,"and i mean it filled up my light fixtures, because they're the old kind"
b, uh-huh 
sd," and i would go in,"
sd,"and i'd turn on a light in the room, you know"
sd,and the light would come on
sd,and the whole thing would be full of water
sd,and i mean the light would still come on
sd,it didn't blow up or anything 
sd," my neighbor, or a friend of mine when i lived in louisiana, her, -"
sd,"we all lived on base,"
sd,my husband was in the army
b,uh-huh
sd,"she woke up about three or four o'clock in the morning, water dripping from hers"
sd,"the neighbor's la-, uh, washing machine had uh, over done something,"
h,i don't know
sd,"but it was leaking, just pouring water in"
sd,and it all went through to her roof
sd,"and it was coming out of the lights, fixtures"
b,oh
sd,the fire alarm went off for some reason
sd,"it shorted it out, or something"
ba,"oh, yeah,"
ba,that will happen
sd,so she woke up with about six feet of water in her house
ba,"oh, my lord"
ar,"no,"
sd,not six feet
%,"but, -"
^2,"but it's quite a bit, quite a bit,"
sv,"you know that,"
aa,yeah
%,you might as well
qy,so did you have carpets and stuff?
no,"oh, several of our rooms got ruined,"
sd,"we have, um, -"
sd,"we h-, are on pier and beam,"
sd,"we don't have concrete slab underneath our house,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," so it, it got into the carpeting, got into the floor"
sd,"the carpeting was already awful anyway,"
sd,but it got into the floor and rotted the floor and made it stink
%,"s-, -"
sd,your house sounds like mine because mine's pier and beam too
b,oh really
ny,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sd,they came in
sd,"and they had it, -"
sd,one room they completely cut up the floor in and removed it
sd,we had to call the insurance company
sd,i mean the insurance company was paying for the new roof
sd,"but they also ended up having to pay for the damage when the re-, roof was being repaired"
b,uh-huh
sd, i mean we'd done everything we could to keep out the weather
ba,that's right
ba,that's right
%,"and, -"
sv,well you got to redo it the way you wanted it in the end
ba,oh yeah
%,"it, -"
qy,are you finished with it now?
qy^d,"uh, the roof?"
ny,uh-huh
ny,"oh yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"it's, it's been done for quite some time"
sd,we're really glad with all the rain we've had in the last couple of years that we have a really good roof
b,"uh-huh,"
qw,how long have you lived there?
sd,"uh, see, it's three, -"
sd,"it's just been a-, at three years"
sd,we've been in the house just the three years
sd,we've been doing a lot of remodeling
sd,"i mean, it's, it had detached, it had a dir-, detached garage"
sd,and my husband's built a walkway across
sd,and we're going to brick up the garage to match the house and things like that
%,"so we, -"
qy,you all did it yourselves?
qy^d,"what, uh, the walk?"
no,the home improvements
ny,"oh yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"he see he does this for a living,"
b, uh-huh 
sd," i mean this is what, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
b^m,okay
sd,"universal health insurance,"
^g,right?
na,that's right
qw,what would we like to say 
sv," i think, -"
b,uh-huh
sv,i think that's what the subject is about
qy,"did you read, uh, the article in the paper today about this particular subject?"
qy,"in the dallas, the morning times?"
ny,yeah
sd,i guess i did not
sd,"uh, the state of washington and the state of minnesota is, uh, going to begin testing a program, a state funded program for citizens of those two states"
sd,"and there's fourteen other, uh, states that are considering it least according to the article in the paper this morning"
sv,"i think it's a trend that's, that's, that's, uh, probably may go nationwide eventually because i think national health is something that we all need"
sv,"it's getting to a point that you have to have it,"
sv,you have to have some form of health insurance
sv,"well, it's been interesting that we, -"
sv,"extremely expensive, though"
aa,yes
sv,"so we live in a society, though, where everyone if you ask them on polls, will, uh, say that they think that everyone has a right to health care"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and yet, i don't think we've ever quite decided who's really supposed to pay for it"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","well, that's the thing, you know,"
sv,"uh, unfortunately the ones that currently pay and pay the premiums for health insurance are, are paying for the people that don't have health insurance"
sv,"which is why people are talking about , -"
sv,we ought to just admit it perhaps 
b,yeah
sv,"i don't think you, uh, -"
qy,you have health insurance?
ny,"yes,"
sd,i do
qy^d,through your company?
sd,"uh, through my company,"
ny,yes
sd,"but i have been in a situation, uh, recently where i was laid off from a position as a sales manager of a company and was off work for about a year"
sd,and my wife developed cancer
sd,we didn't have any 
ba,"oh, my goodness"
sd,and it was a 
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",that's must have been hard 
qo,how was your care at parkland?
sv,"uh, because it was a life threatening situation, it was very good"
sd,"uh, as it, as it turned out one of the top, uh, people, or one of the top doctors in the state that is involved in cancer treatment was at parkland"
sd,"but, yet, parkland is not free, either"
aa,"no,"
sd,"it's not free,"
sd,"but, uh,"
qy,is it affordable?
sv,so you did have a good experience
ar,i had a bad experience as it turned out
sv,"uh, i was fortunate that there was parkland"
qy,"is your wife better, i hope?"
ng,"uh, no she passed away"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",i'm real sorry
bd,that's all right
b,sure *listen; is this a question?
bd,that happens
sd,"it does happen,"
sv,but it's very sad
b,"yeah,"
sd,"but in any event, uh, i'm in favor of national health"
sd,well 
sd," actually, uh, i'm a pediatrician "
bh,"oh, is that right?"
sd," and i feel very strongly about, uh, children, and, uh, developed very strong feelings about this during our measles epidemic "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, uh, i'm really quite active in trying to, uh, be proactive at least for children's issues"
sv,"it's very complex, very complicated,"
sv,"but, uh, i strongly believe that all children have a right to immunization, glasses, hearing aids , basic health benefits"
sd,"well, i, when i grew up and -"
sd,"i grew up in south central kansas, uh,"
sd,"we had, -"
sd,"and my mom worked for the health department, the county health department"
sd,"and we had x-rays every year,"
sd,"we had a dentist come to our school and, uh, check our teeth once a year at least"
sd,"uh, we had all our flu shots taken care of, our measles, mumps, rubella and all that other stuff"
%,um
sd,"and, uh, when my children were growing up, we didn't have that"
sd,"we had to pay for it, which i wasn't opposed to paying for it"
sd,"i had the money to pay for it,"
sv,but i'm sure that there were people that don't
sd,"well, and the costs have, so much has gone up so much"
sd,"the cost of immunizations for example, uh, and just the legal , the legal benefits, uh,"
sv,"that has really forced people into doing a lot of things unnecessarily, et cetera"
b,uh-huh
h,"so, well, i don't know,"
sv,"it's, it is interesting,"
sd,"in case you didn't know, texas leads the nation in uninsured children"
sd,thirty-one percent of all texas children 
sd,did not know that
sd,"so, uh, one out of every three children has nothing to reimburse them for their health care"
sd,and i work in the children's parkland system
sd,and it's pretty overwhelming to me
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, it's pretty hard to be indigent and to be dependent upon indigent health care systems in dallas county"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
ad,why don't you go ahead and start
aa,"okay,"
sd,"well, we subscribe to people magazine and to time,"
sd,"and, of course i like the people magazine because it's gossipy "
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, uh, the time of course, is, uh, you know, more newsworthy"
sv,"and, uh, it has more world affair type things, of course"
sd,"and then i will purchase a good housekeeping occasionally, especially around the holiday time because of recipes and ideas and "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
qy," and, uh, do you subscribe to any magazines?"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i, well, i have, in a whi-, for a while i haven't gotten any because i just find that i'm not reading what i'm getting because, uh, i have so much going on in my life"
sd,"that seems to be the last thing i pick up,"
sd,"so i found that i was wasting my money as much as i enjoy them, uh, when i do subscribe"
sd,"i, i've gotten in the past the parents magazine and, uh, the housekeeping magazine "
b,uh-huh 
%, uh
qy^d, you probably have smaller children 
ny,"yes,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"my children, our children are grown "
ny,"yeah,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd," and, uh, i'm letting their mother read on the grandchildren "
b," right,"
sd,"well, i found that after a couple of years of having a parents magazine it was getting repetitious,"
sd,so i kind of canceled it anyway for that reason
sd,"uh, the housekeeping magazines i do like because they, like you say, they have nice, uh, recipes in them and ideas, but, uh, lately they've just been piling up on me,"
sd,"so i figured it wasn't, uh, something i needed at this point in time"
qy,"well, do you think that people subscribe to magazines as much as they used to?"
no,"i don't know,"
%,"i, i, well, -"
sd,my husband would love to have more
sd,"now he's the type who will get the, uh, inc magazine and money magazine and all the financial type magazines,"
b,"yes,"
sd,"now my husband does that,"
%,and -
b,"yeah,"
sd," you know, and of course, uh, naturally wall street journal, you know "
b,"uh-huh,"
h,"but i don't know,"
sd,i know a few people leafing through them at the store -
sv," but you just don't hear people talk about them,"
sd,"and i know years ago, when, uh, my children were young and stuff, i just loved ladies home journal, mccall's, good housekeeping,"
sd,and i took them all 
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, then, oh, i don't know what -"
sd,"in the seventies, maybe, late seventies they changed their format "
b,uh-huh
%," and i haven't, -"
sv,i don't think there's been a magazine as they used to be 
b,well -
sv," even good housekeeping i don't, -"
b," yeah,"
sv,"and some of those have had what, what i consider or what -"
sv,"i get the idea that they are maybe the, the more pricier type magazines, as far as women's magazines"
sv,"they seem just to be so chocked full of, of ads"
aa,"oh, they are"
sd,"my sister, uh, takes, uh, town and country and vogue "
b,uh-huh
sd," and she sends them to me,"
sv,and there's really nothing in them but advertisements 
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
b,yes
b,right 
sd," you know, and if i want to drool or if i want to see how the other half is living "
b,yes
b,yeah
sd," and i do,"
%,"i just, -"
sd,"what i do is i flip through them and, and pitch them then, you know,"
sd,"they're not something i, you know, take any length of time over"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i have discovered that, you know, with my available time, i would rather actually read a book "
b,yes 
sd, i enjoy books a lot more 
b,yes 
sv, that's true
%," and, uh -"
%,well 
%,"so, but -"
sd," now i have certainly stopped subscribing as much as i used to,"
sd,other than my children have gotten -
sd,"you know, they get tons of magazines it seems "
b,yes 
sd, they're always getting something in the mail
sd,"and, and, uh, so between reading to them and, uh, reading the newspaper, -"
sd,"and then i have a book that i'm occasionally reading when i get a chance,"
sd,"but i just don't get a chance for those, uh, newsy magazines, the ones that are full of ads,"
sv,"unless you just want to skim through while you're, -"
sd,"i, i read them when i'm at a doctor's office or, you know, waiting on something like that"
b,"yes,"
b,"yes,"
sd,"i will read them in a doctor's office, too"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"as i said, i, i subscribe to, uh, to people and to time,"
sd,"and, uh, and i will go through the time, but, usually not cover to cover, you know,"
sd,i'll glance through it
sd,"i like reading, uh, you know, the passage of people or something "
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, but i do like the people magazine"
sd,"it, it reminds me of the old time movie magazines when i was young "
b,"oh, uh-huh"
sd," and, uh, that's one, and you know, i really like that,"
sd,i enjoy that
sd,it's quick reading 
b,uh-huh
sd,"it doesn't require a lot of thinking,"
sd,and sometimes after i've worked all day 
b,yeah
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd, i don't want a lot of thinking 
ba," that's true,"
sv,that kind of is a good way to do it
sd,"it, uh, you know, it's, it's much more relaxing"
sd,"sometimes when i read time magazine, after i've read an article i'm real depressed over the situation of the world ,"
sv,"so well, it seems like we both kind of agree on the subject of magazines "
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
%," and, uh -"
fc,okay
fc," so, uh, i think that probably i will end the call"
fc,"i've enjoyed, -"
sd,"so, the, the topic is hobbies "
^2,in your spare time
b,yeah
qh,who has spare time ?
sd,"um, i don't really, don't really do any handicraft things like that"
sd,"i used to i used to do, like salt ornaments and things"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but that was, oh, good many, many years ago"
%,and 
b,yeah
sd,"i usually go do aerobics and read,"
sd,"and that's,"
b, yeah 
b,yeah
sd,i understood that
sd,"i'm, you know, i work full time"
sd,and i have two kids 
sd,so my spare time usually involves something with the kids
b,yeah
%,"you know, hobbies, -"
sd,"we, i, i can't really say that we have hobbies"
sd,it's more like maybe projects or something on the weekend
sd," you know, we like to go out < >,"
b," yeah, "
%,family
sd,"well, well, that's what i meant by salt that we, we did that like as a family, little ornaments and,"
b,oh
b,uh-huh
b,right
%,but 
b,uh-huh
sd,"i've just never been very skilled at,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and the things i've tried to do just don't look very good ,"
%,"and, -"
sd,"i, i guess mostly as far as, as crafts go, i've done, um, some needlepoint"
sd,i've done mostly cross stitching
sd,"i used to, uh, do like, um, -"
sd,"one that i did for both kids are like, oh, -"
sd,"they're plaques with, you know, different kind of animals"
sd,"and then you have their birth date on them,"
b,yeah
sd,and then you have a little picture of them
sd,"and you frame them and stuff,"
b,uh-huh
sd,but nothing steady
sd,"just when i get some spare time here and there i'll work on it,"
sd,"but, you know, it's nothing that i,"
bf,"it's not,"
aa,no
aa,not at all
b,yeah
sd,i don't even know how to knit
sd,"and my mother used to knit, you know,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"and, and i don't even know how to knit ,"
sd,"i'm like, that's a lost art from this family "
b,yeah
%,"so, um, -"
sv,"but, it's not a very good topic"
h,"it feels like,"
aa, no 
%,"not when you're n-, -"
sd,"neither one of us are really, -"
sd,"i, i have seen things i really like,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"needlepoint,"
b,yeah
sv,"but, it just seems like there'd be so much time involved in it,"
b,yeah
sv,"it's like, god, it, it seems like it's easier just to go out and buy it already made "
sd," i don't know what, what, is, -"
sd,"it's like there, -"
sd,"but here a lot of the country stuff is in, you know, a lot of the woodwork, a lot of, uh, stenciling"
b,yeah
sd,"and, you know, you can go to any, like a flea market and stuff"
sd,and there's just tons of stuff everywhere
sd,"and,"
b, yeah 
sd,and then on weekends they go out and sell it
sd,and during the week they go back and do some more
bf,"and see, they do that as their job whereas,"
aa, right 
sd,and they make it cheaper for us to buy 
aa,yeah 
aa,definitely
%,"so, -"
sv,"but, and, i mean, i'm sure it must be relaxing to do things like that"
sd,"because i can remember when i used to do, you know, those little salt, those figurines and things"
sv,"it was, it was relaxing, you know, creative,"
sv,you felt very creative
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, it just was so time, time,"
b, yeah 
b,uh-huh
%,"so, -"
%,"and, -"
b, okay 
sv,"well, i think, i think we're okay"
sv,"i think we did the five minutes,"
sd,so we don't have to keep talking about nothing anymore 
b,yeah
%," so, -"
b, okay 
ft,"well, thank you"
bd,okay
sd,i hope you have a good rest of your weekend

"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sd,we're energized
b,okay
sd,"um, painting,"
sd,interesting
sd,"uh, the guy called me,"
sd,"when she called me, the computer called me, i thought that they were reading my mind"
sd,"i'm in the middle of, um, going out for bids to have my house painted"
b,oh
sd,"uh, painting is not hard to do, uh,"
aa,no
b,right
sd,and our house is not -
sd,but it's starting to bleed through and burn through because the paint's real cheap
sd,and it's just a hassle to go through it
sd,so i'm looking for the easy way out
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"uh, i know"
%,"di-, -"
qy,"is easy to find pa-, uh, painters to do this for you?"
no,"it's easier to find painters,"
sd,"but you have to be, you have to be aware of what, uh, how messy they can get and are they going to put on a good, a good two coats, and are they,"
%,"ri-, -"
qy,"are you talking,"
sd,exterior
b^m,"exterior,"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sv,"uh, interior's not so bad because it's more fun,"
%,"it's more, c-, -"
%,"but yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"outside you have high peeks,"
b,yeah
sv,it can be a real issue
sd,"well, when we've painted, um, -"
sd,"right now our house doesn't have to have the same kind of exterior painting there,"
sd,"it's more trim because it has some of the old asbestos shingles,"
b,uh-huh
sd,so there isn't as much wood that has to be painted
%,"um, but, i-, it, -"
sd,"the problem is that it hits, the sun hits it"
sd,"so preparing is a real problem,"
b,uh-huh
sd,you've got to prepare it well
sd,or else it will flake
b,uh-huh
%,"um,"
%,"here they, -"
sd,"some of the home builders are, -"
sd,they don't put brick on the side of your house just to save money
sd,"so they put up, uh, a quarter inch masonite, basically,"
sd,and they painted it kind of like a spun of a sorts 
sd,so it's real cheap
sd,"and, uh, uh, i've had thirteen hundred dollar bid and i, as low as five hundred and forty dollars"
%,"so it's,"
ba,wow
%,"it's, -"
sd,"oh, there one guy brags about his piece of equipment he's using and the drop cloths and all that kind crap"
sd,"and i'm so much worried about that as what,"
b,yeah
%,"and, -"
aa," yeah,"
sv,"which might be a bigger problem than it would be, uh, -"
ba,"oh, sure"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,absolutely 
qy^d,"so y'all, you haven't had any, any jobs painted in your house or recently "
nn,"no,"
sd,"we 've have, uh, done a little painting ourselves, um,"
sd,"we painted the bedroom, uh, well within the last t-, couple of months,"
ba,that's fun
sd,"and we have, we have some more that need to be done,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but the, the problem that we've, we've owned this house almost five years now,"
sd,"and, um, when we bought it the, um, it had been vacant for a while because the family will retired, "
sd,but the daughter was a real estate agent
sd,and she was selling it
sd,and it's been lived in briefly by her before she bought her town house
sd,"so she told us that the house had been, uh, professionally painted recently"
sd,"and it looked pretty good, you know, the, uh, the interior walls all basically white,"
sd,"but they obviously had been done without to much, uh, wear afterward"
sd,"the only problem was when we started having the movers move the furniture in we identified various rooms by pieces of masking tape on the wood-, uh, the door frames,"
b,uh-huh
sd,when we took the masking tape off half the painted came with it
ba,"uh, that's not very, -"
sd,big long strips
sd,so what had happened is that professional painters had not prepared the surface properly
sd,and some of still has to be redone
bf,"oh, they just painted over varnished wood"
aa,"yeah,"
ba,"oh, my,"
ar,"well, no"
sd,"actually it had been, uh, it would have been, it had been a repaint job"
b,um
sd,"but they had not, -"
sd,either they had painted with the wrong kind of paint over top
sd,"or they hadn't really roughed it up or whatever they,"
sd,because it was woodwork
sd,"so it looked as if it had been painted,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, um, it had not,"
sd,either that or it had not been prepared underneath
sd,"and it was greasy or something,"
b,sure
sd,"it comes off in strips, i mean not even little bit"
sd,"so we still have some of that trim work to do because we put it off all this time,"
ba,"oh, no"
sd,we know what a job it's going to be
sd,"because you almost have to strip the whole thing,"
b,um
fc,i wish you good luck
fc,okay 
fc,thank you very much
fc,thank you
fc,bye-bye
fc,bye
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay 
qy,was i supposed to do something?
nn,no
sd,i had to press one
ba,good 
^h,"uh, let's see,"
qy,"so, uh, were we right in the middle east?"
na,sure
qy,should we have been there?
ny,uh-huh
qy,did we do what was correct there?
sv,i think we should have stayed longer
qy,should we have fought them harder?
qy^d,used more weapons equal to their chemical weapons that weren't used?
na,"uh, i think what we did was good,"
sv,but i think we just should have stayed there longer and continued doing what we did do
qy^d,"oh, you agree with schwartzkopf who says, uh, drive on into baghdad"
ny,yeah
sv,i think we should have stayed and kind of helped the people in iraq out now because it's kind of like a civil war going on now
sv,and it's almost like they're killing each other off
sv,and there is not going to be anything left of iraq at all <<sounds like zipping>>
qy,would that be so bad?
qy,was there anything there to begin with?
sv,"well, i think, i don't think it would be good if we were to completely lose it, um"
sv,it wasn't ours
aa,"well, no,"
sv,"i just mean that, that, the world in general "
sv,"we've got to talk so it's just, just as well we argue"
aa,yeah
h,"um, i don't know,"
sv,"i think we should have helped the, the innocent people in iraq out a little bit more,"
aa,i agree
qy,wouldn't it have been wonderful if we could have freed the country
ny,yes 
sv,"but i think that's almost impossible, next to impossible"
b,yeah
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",so other political things that's going on
sd,"i heard mister bush say, excuse me, president bush say that he, uh, wanted to improve the highways"
sd,"oh, see, i haven't really been keeping up with them"
sd,so i really don't know what he said
qw,what did he say about it?
sv,"oh, he wanted to take the current secondary highway system "
b,uh-huh
sv,we don't have the money for that
qy^d,but wouldn't it be wonderful
na, it would be really nice because i'm kind of tired of driving in pot holes 
qy,"and back east,"
qw,what's that?
fa,"i'm sorry, i dropped the phone "
bk,"oh, okay, um,"
qy,i say back east you all drive at fifty-five don't you?
ny,yeah
sd,"see, out here in the west a lot of our secondary roads are fifty-five "
b,uh-huh
sd, we drive sixty-five
b,"oh, really"
ny,"oh, yes"
sd,"well, i, uh, last weekend, went home to visit my parents"
sd,my dad's in the hospital
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, between here and west texas, there was probably three and four hours at sixty-five miles an hour"
sd,"oh, i didn't realize that"
sd,nonstop
qy,have you ever been out here?
nn,"no,"
nn,huh-uh
qw,how far west have you been?
sd,only in ohio
qy^d,"oh, you've never,"
sd,i've never been past ohio
nn,"no,"

qy^d,yellowstone?
ng,i've never been there
sd,"i've seen pictures,"
sd,"i just, i'm a college student"
sd,"and, um, i'm paying for my own education"
sd,"and i'm, i come from a large family"
sd,"and we, we we're never able to take vacations because there's, there's twelve kids in the family"
%,"uh,"
%,"so, -"
sd,"well, my college educa-, uh, thirty-six, -"
sd,worked for texas instruments for seventeen or eighteen now
ba,"oh, my"
sd,"uh, know, virtually nothing else"
b, uh-huh
b,"uh, yeah"
sd,"i got my four year,"
b,uh-huh
b,really
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i know,"
sd,it's a funny degree 
sd,"anyway, uh, i know nothing other than the west"
b,yeah
sd,"in fact, uh, down in east texas "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,and it's really interesting
b,uh-huh
ad,so tell me about where you live
sd,"well, um, i'm, i'm originally from butler"
sd,and that's about an hour away from where i am now
sd,i'm at clairon
sd,"and, um, it's, it's pretty, like, windy and hilly"
qw,"uh, how high is the highest elevation?"
sd,"oh, i couldn't even tell you"
%,"like, uh, probably -"
sd,it's not like a mountain
sd,it wouldn't be like a mountain
%,"it's, uh, -"
qy^d, three thousand feet?
no,"oh, i don't even know"
sd,i have no clue
qy^d,close to sea level?
na, i would say it's closer to sea level
b,"okay,"
sd,"uh, right here in colorado springs where i live "
b,uh-huh
b," um, yes"
sd,"when i lived in texas, every year i had to drive, you know"
sd,i drove every year to the gulf
sd,"and, you know, so i could have a feast of fresh seafood "
%,um
sd,"i, i'm really interested in the basic concept differences between west and east coast and the central parts of america"
b,uh-huh
qw,how many hours have you been from home?
qy^d,"uh, the farthest away from home?"
ny,yes
sd,"probab-, i'd say five or six"
b,"oh, yeah"
ny,uh-huh
sd,"uh, now when i was growing up in the panhandle of texas, -"
sd,"look at your map later and see the, the town of amarillo "
b,uh-huh
sd,"to just go buy a pair of jeans, we'd drive an hour"
ba,"oh, my "
ba,"oh, my gosh"
sd,"when i was growing up,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and people buy jeans in town,"
sd,"but uh, we thought nothing at all of wake up, waking up in the morning hopping into your car, grabbing the fishing poles and driving four hours"
ba,"oh, yes"
sd,"now see for me, that's a long ways"
aa,yeah
ba,it is i imagine
b,uh-huh
sd,"even, well, like, i, i'm in like a little town right now"
sd,it's smaller than butler
sd,"and, um, butler, butler is about an hour north east of pittsburgh"
sv,so that will give you some idea of where i'm at
b,okay
sd,"and i'm about,"
b,"okay,"
oo_co_cc,i'll look at my map later
ba,wow
ba,how neat
sd,"and, uh, i mean just this, this little town here is basically a college town"
sd,"the college, without the college here, this town would be nothing"
sd,it would be absolutely dead
sd,because it's completely made up of fast food restaurants
sd,"and, and in the summer when we co-, uh, -"
sd,"we come up here in the summer,"
%,"and it's, -"
sd,"i mean, there's just no one around"
qy,so are you working your way through college?
sd,"um, well, i go home in the summer"
sd,and i work in the summer
sd,"and between what i make in the summer and student loans, that's how i go to college"
ba,"well, how neat"
qw,what's your major?
sd,finance
b^m,finance
b,uh-huh
ba,"well, that's interesting"
b,uh-huh
qw,"so, uh, what do you plan to do with it?"
sd,"um, well, like i said my fianc3ee, *typo"
qy^d,"savings and loans, uh,"
nn,no 
nn,"no,"
nn,"no,"
nn,"no,"
sd,"and i'd actually like to work for a company rather than a bank or a, something"
sd,"i'd rather work for a company and, um, like be their financial advisor or something"
ba,"oh, that would be great"
ba,that would be neat 
sd,"let's see, uh, so we're all excited in colorado springs"
b,uh-huh
sd,apple computer is coming to town
b,"oh, really"
ny,yes
sd,"the, uh, new employer is in the city"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so we're expecting our local economy to ,"
^2,take a boom a little bit
qw,"well, well what would be the unemployment rate out there?"
sd,"uh, unemployment runs approximately six percent"
sd,see that's what it is here too
sd,"but, now under employment i would suspect to run closer to eighteen or twenty percent"
b,uh-huh
sd,and the problem is that there are no good permanent full time jobs for people without a technical four year degree
b,yeah
sv,it's even getting hard for the four year people to find jobs
aa,yes
sv,it is
sd,i know people they are out of school for two or three years
sd,and they have a job that has nothing to do -
qy,so have you heard about saturns?
^h, <<he seems to be out of breath>> i've heard some about saturns
sd,i don't know a lot about them
sd,"i haven't been over, uh, to a dealer to look at them although i did see something in tonight's paper that said that their, uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the, i guess, the japanese cars"
ba,"ooh, that's great"
sd,"actually that's kind of the type of car that i, i'm thinking about we might get"
sd,"saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a, a saturn dealer"
b, yeah
sv,"and, uh, supposedly, they've got great customer satisfaction from what things i've heard"
aa,"um yeah,"
sd,i've heard a lot of people like them
sd,"uh, yet i don't know wh-, whether i would buy saturn or not at this point"
%,"i'm kind of, -"
sv,"my card and, uh, desires tend to be pretty picky"
%,"and so, uh -"
qy^d,"well, like what?"
^h,"well, let's see"
sd,"i li-, i like cars that are designed with, with human beings in mind,"
sd,and that's not just the driver and the passenger
sd,"but that's the person who's working on it,"
sd,"cause i do al-, almost all my own maintenance and, uh "
b, uh-huh 
sd,"and i found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in, uh, finding a ca-, car anymore that's, that's fairly easy for me to work on, it's just not very eas-, it's not very, -"
sv,almost unlikely at this point
b,yeah
%,"and, uh, yo-, -"
b,yeah
sd,i've got a sixty-five mustang
sd, and 
ba, ooh 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and when i look at modern cars and stuff like that, i just say i will never do that with the modern cars"
sv,it's not worth my time
sv,you can't get in there
sv,you can't do anything
b,yeah
sv,and it's so complicated too
sd,i look at it
sd,"and i say, boy, you know,"
sd,"i, i'd have to almost go take a class or something like that"
sd, well i've got an eighty-three saab
b,uh-huh
sv,"and i find that for a normal, you know, everyday things it's really very easy to work on"
sd,"and so, uh, you know, i'm kind of spoiled"
sd,i used to have a chevy
b, uh-huh 
sd, with a three fifty in it
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, i really liked working on it uh, cause it was pretty easy too"
sd,it was about a nineteen seventy
sd,"so i'm kind of, uh, biased in that"
sv,"and, you know, i want a car that i can work on because i think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore"
b,yeah 
sv,"and that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing i'd look at"
sv,i think another thing i'd look at is safety
aa,yeah
sd,that's one of the things that my wife and i have thought about
sd,"actually, the car, one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one ford taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual "
b, huh 
sv,"that's a real nice car, i think"
b,yeah 
sd,"i've driven some, uh, tauruses over the last couple of years when i've been on business trips"
b,uh-huh 
sd,and i've always been very impressed with the taurus
sv,it's a really nice car
sv,"i think it's very , it's a stylish car both inside and out"
sv,it's comfortable to drive
sv,"uh, reasonable performance,"
sv,"and this is out in california where, where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore"
b,yeah
sd,"uh, i've been real impressed with that"
%,"yo-, -"
sd,"and i didn't realize that they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that car now "
sd," ninety,"
%,yeah 
sd,"or, excuse me, the ninety-twos "
sd,the 
b, uh-huh 
sd,this newest model
sd, you could 
sv," oh, i think that, "
sv,"that's excellent because, -"
b, yeah 
sd,but the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars
sd,"actually, my, my wife and i are actually thinking, contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so"
sd,so we're actually 
b, oh 
sd,we'd like to get like a -
h,"oh, i don't know"
qw,what do you call it?
sd,a dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know
b,uh-huh
sd,year old ninety-two or something like that
b,uh-huh
b,sure
%, those are -
%," see if we, -"
b," yeah,"
sv,"that, that would be a good deal to go with"
sd,and the other thing we're looking at is the saturns too 
b, okay 
sv,because they looked really nice
b,uh-huh
qw,"what do you, what do you looking for in, in those?"
qw,"what, what attracts you to the saturns?"
sd,"or, or, of course, we've already talked, you know, -"
sv,the taurus is safe
qo,"but wh-, what kind of things are you looking for? "
sd," well, the saturns you can get air bags in them"
sd,i don't think you can get dual side air bags
b,uh-huh
sd,"but one of the, the two things that i'm really, -"
sv,"the, the i'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart that doesn't have problems"
b,uh-huh
sd,you set down
sd,you look at consumer reports
sd,we've been pouring over consumer reports
sv,and you just get so depressed for the u s auto 
b,yeah
sd,because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have
sd,"and, and the two cars that apparently are close to that that actually have high reliability, the taurus is one of the highest u s cars"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and the other one is, are the saturns"
b,uh-huh
sd,so those two things
sd,"and then, you know, we kind of want a four door"
b,okay 
sd," uh, the only work i do outside the home is i am an avon representative"
b,"oh, okay"
sd,and i sell family products
b,uh-huh
%,"and, uh, -"
qy,"do you, -"
sd,"so i, i don't really, i don't really dress up a whole lot"
qy,do you work outside?
arp_nd,"well, i, i work, uh, -"
sd,i'm a c p a
sd,and i do contract work
bk,"oh, uh-huh"
sd,"and so, and i work with another c p a who just started his own practice "
b,oh
sd, and i work with him a couple days a week 
b,uh-huh
sd," and so when i go to his office or to other clients' offices, then i'll dress up "
b,uh-huh
sd, but otherwise it's great being at home 
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so that, that makes it pretty nice"
sd,it's 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, and, uh, it seemed like i was wearing a suit every day, just about"
sv,"well, you'd have to dress differently when you're working every day, i think"
b,right
b,yeah
b,"right,"
%,"and so it's, uh, -"
sd,some of my suits i haven't put on for quite a 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"so it's,"
sd,it's kind of nice to relax a little bit
b,yeah
b,"gosh,"
sd,"well, my, my dress up, -"
sd,i live out in the country also
sd,so 
b,uh-huh
b,sure
sd,"uh, so i really, i know a lot of the avon representatives are portrayed as being very dressed up"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, i mostly dress, i try to dress nice, but for convenience, because when the weather's bad, when i go into the home i take off my shoes "
b,uh-huh
b,right
sd,"and i don't too often take off my coat even,"
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sv,"well, i imagine that where you live, uh, you're in warm clothing quite a bit of the year"
qy,not really?
bh,"oh, is that right?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"and the rest is, uh, gets into the cooler weather"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"course, they keep saying the weather's going to change and we're going to have more florida type weather up here ,"
h,so i 
b,uh-huh
sd,"but for now,"
sv,so you all are waiting for that 
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"now, my daughter works all the time,"
sd,so she dresses -
sv,"i think, you know, you have to spend more money on your clothing, and that "
b,right
b,right
b,yeah
sd,"well, down here it's sunny most of the time"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i mean, we had a few cool days, uh, this month,"
sd,"but not anything, i'm sure, compared to what you've had so far"
b,"um, uh-huh"
sd,"so, i mean people are still wearing shorts"
sd,and 
b,uh-huh
sd,so 
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,"right,"
b,yeah
sd,"but, that, that lasts, you know, for a few months "
qy,"did you find you wore, uh, slacks when you were working full time"
qrr,or did you 
nn,no
nn,"no,"
sd,never wore slacks
b^m,no slacks
sd,"it was, i think it was one of those things where, it's not like someone came out and said you can't wear them"
b,uh-huh
sd,it was one of those understood things 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
qy^d,"not even a dressy slack, a dressy suit, slack suit even "
nn,"not, -"
nn,"no,"
sd,"not, not with what i did uh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,most people didn't
b,uh-huh
sd,"sometimes, like the secretaries might "
b,uh-huh
sd, but even then you didn't see them wearing slacks too much
%,"and i really, you know, -"
sv,there's some nice pantsuits out
sd,and 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
%," but, uh, -"
sd,"i know my daughter mostly, -"
sd,i don't think she ever wears slacks 
b,uh-huh
sd,"but i didn't know if the trend changes, you know, if, uh, -"
sv,"you know, i think it's one of those things where it's not viewed upon as being professional"
sd,i guess they 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,"look more like a woman, huh "
aa,yeah
aa, that's right 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,and it's the men that make the rules 
sv,"uh, well, then you, you, you know why they make them then ,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","but, no,"
%,"we usually, you know, -"
sd,"skirt and, skirt and blouse or suit or dress "
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,so it's nice with me working at home because i can wear pants
b,yeah
sd,"no, no one can see me "
b,yeah
sv,"but, yet, you need to keep up an appearance for your husband, too, though "
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"but, i'm not going to put a skirt on just for him "
qy,"oh, you don't think you will, huh ?"
sd,"well, you'll be excused because considering everything -"
b,"yeah,"
sv,i think that the main issue at home 
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
sd,"but i, i look at homemaking as a job also"
b,right
sv,"and i, i think sometimes we lose sight of that"
b,yeah
qo,"well, what do you know about latin american policies?"
sv," well, i think they're kind of ambivalent, really"
sv,"uh, i just have a feeling that we've kind of talked out of both sides of mouths down there like we do in some other situations "
b,uh-huh
sv,"we, we don't know, half the time we don't know who to support"
na,"that, and, you know, maybe it's, maybe it's tough for a big powerful nation to deal with, with, uh, countries like that that depend on us so much "
b,right
%,"but, -"
ba,"that, that's just it"
sv,"it's got to be tough,"
sv,"but, i mean, uh, uh, you sure, you still have to, you know, let them know how you feel"
aa,"right,"
sv,"i guess my concern, you know, no matter which, no matter which side we take , we're going to have supporters and we're going to have, uh, antisupporters, i guess, for lack of better term,"
aa,"and, uh, like you said, they're such small countries, that we're bound to upset somebody,"
sv,but we seem to be lacking the ability to take a stance
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"it worries me that, uh, the economy of so many countries in, in south america and central america depend on something that damages people, like the, you know, like cocaine "
b,right
sv,and 
b,right
sv,but 
aa,that's true
%,"and it, -"
%,"i don't think that, -"
sv,"maybe i, maybe it's, you know, i'm reflecting how i feel about it,"
sv,"but i have a feeling that we, that we really don't understand basically the, the, the competing factions in lot of those countries"
sv,and 
aa,sure
sv,"and it's still going on,"
sv,"and, uh, we, we dabble in it just enough to make both sides angry at us some how,"
aa,"yep,"
aa,that's about the lump sum of it
sd,"well, um, i was speaking with a, a woman"
sd,"from, i believe she was from the honduras or guatemala, or somewhere in there,"
ar,"no,"
sd,she was from el salvador 
b,yeah

qy^d,"well, you know who i'm talking about"
na,i can see his face forget his name 
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i, i know it, uh,"
sv,"anyway, when he came into power, he basically just took everybody's property, you know, just assigned it to himself"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,kind of nationalized it 
b,right 
aa," right,"
sd,"and, uh, so she's been a real strong supporter of the sandinistas and has been trying to back the u s government in that respect,"
sv,and in that respect i have to agree that i think we're taking the right stance 
b,yeah
^2,"dictator, -"
aa," yeah,"
aa,right 
b,yeah
sv, basically a dictator fascist -
sv,"and it seems like those countries are so easily susceptible to that kind of thing,"
sv,it just 
aa,sure
qo,"well, what do you think of, uh, this, uh, u s free trade agreement we're working on with mexico?"
sv,"well, i think it's long overdue "
b,uh-huh
%," uh, i just, you know, -"
sv,"there's so much difference in, in the economies of the two countries, i'm not, you know, i have a problem, uh, with whether it's going to work or not, you know,"

%,"and i, -"
sv,"this may be unfair to mexico,"

aa,"uh-huh,"
%,"mexico, -"
sv,"they're, i know they're trying, they're really trying, the mexican government is trying,"
sv,"and a lot of the larger mexican businesses are trying to, oh, make themselves americanized, i guess "
b,yeah
sv,the big problem with the united states is we have our basic nine to five schedule 
b,yeah 
sd,and 
b, yeah
sv,"and there's, the cultural differences is what's, is what's kind of, it's what's really hurting, uh, the mexican people, because they've had their way of life,"
sv,"and we've had our way of life,"

ny,"yeah,"
sv,i think so
bk,uh-huh

aa,"oh, yes,"
sv,i think so
b, uh-huh
qy,"are you, uh, are you someone who works outside your home,"
qrr,"or have you, -"
ny,"yeah,"
ny,yeah
sd,i work for t i
b,"oh, yes,"
bk,uh-huh
qy,"well, uh, have there been significant changes, uh, do you think in the employment place, ex-, especially, uh, say at t i"
ny,uh-huh
qy,"have, has anything in particular changed that you have noticed?"
%,"uh,"
sv,"uh, i guess there's more women in, uh, what would be classified as a man's job "
bk,"yeah,"
bk,uh-huh
qw,"what, what kind of work do you do?"
sd,i am a drafter
bk,uh-huh
sd,i am in a man's job 
aa,right
sd,but we have got more women in it now
aa,"yes,"
aa,yes
sd,there's a lot of us in it
b,"yes, uh,"
%,so -
b,yes
sv,"in years past, i know, in fact, even, even the word drafter has changed,"
%,uh
sd,"because, it used to be they were draftsman "
aa,"uh-huh,"
sd,"we have some engineers that still, on their, uh, -"
sd,the drawings that they mark up for us they put draftsman
b,right
sd,and i want to scratch it out and put drafter 
sd,"but i thought, well i am,"
^2," maybe not, huh "
sd,"well, uh, i, when i was in college, -"
sd,i graduated from college with my bachelor's degree in nineteen sixty-four
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i was a math major, which was a real rarity,"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"so, i was in a lot of classes where, uh, there, i was either the only girl or, you know, one of just a very,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,"so, that was a change"
sd,"and, uh, even, uh , i did not, uh, use my math, uh, in my work,"
sd,"i, i became a technical writer"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, even so, there were very, very few women in technical writing"
b,yeah
sv,"but, that has changed a lot"
b,"oh, yeah"
sv,"in recent years it has just really, really changed a lot"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, and i think that, uh, you know, the one thing that i have seen is that more and more women are getting into management,"
sv,but i think they have got a long way to go 
aa,"oh, definitely,"
aa,definitely
sd,"there was something on t v the other day that said that fewer than one or two percent of the heads of, uh, chairmen of the board, chair-, chair persons, uh, if you sa-, if you will,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,"and i thought that, you know, that's pretty si-, a pretty significantly small number"
b,yeah
sv,"so, there are some, some strides to be made there"
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
h,"but, uh, i do not know,"
sv,"i, i think we have come a long way,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sd,"and, uh,"
b,yeah
%,"do you, -"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
aa,exactly
qy,"so, anyway do you have children?"
nn,"no,"
nn,huh-uh
sd,i was going to say do you have daughters
sv,that's always a good question
qy, do you?
ny,yes
sd,"in fact, i have a daughter who is in a, a, who just graduated in civil engineering, from college"
ba,"oh, wonderful"
sd,"so, she is pretty much, although there were some other women in her class,"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, she definitely entering into, uh, a male profession"
aa,"oh, yeah"
sd,"but, uh,"
aa,yeah
b,uh-huh
sv,"so, that is recognized,"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
h,"but, uh, i do not know,"
sv,"i, you see it in, uh, also in, uh, like in church, uh, where more and more women are becoming ministers"
b,"oh, yeah"
sv,"and, uh, it will be interesting to see if, if roman catholicism ever, uh, recognizes women in,"
qy^d,"i do-, i do not know if you are roman catholic or,"
nn,"no,"
nn,huh-uh
b,uh-huh
sd,"i am not either,"
sv,"but, uh, that is one area where it, that i can see might change, but i really doubt will change "
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sv,not for a long time anyway
aa,"no,"
aa,probably not
aa,huh-uh
qw,"so, uh, uh, how about, what in particular would you think that, uh, women still, other than the work place, where women still are being, uh, oh, you know, found wanting, you know, or not re-, as highly regarded as men would be uh,"
sd,i was just trying to think
sd,"oh, i know something"
b, uh-huh
%,"maybe you could te-, -"
ad,"what do you think that, what do you think, tell me what you think about this"
b,uh-huh
sd," the, uh, the, uh, the role of women in combat roles during the war?"
b,"oh, oh"
sd,"because, i know that there, now there, they want the armed forces to recognize that women can serve in combat roles"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and the only, uh, branch in the armed fo-, services that seems willing to do that is the air force"
sd,"and,"
%,huh
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,and so but i know some of the other services do not think that women are capable of doing the job
sv,"it was real interesting,"
sd,"they were i was listening to some of the comments on ra-, television the other day,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, one of, one of the men who was a, -"
sd,"i do not know if he was a general or, you know, what his rank was, very high"
b,uh-huh
sd,"he said, it's just a personal thing with me"
^q,"i mean, i can not be real, you know i can not tell you why i feel this way,"
^q,"but i just would rather have, uh, a man doing some of these jobs than a woman"
sd,"i thought, well, at least he was honest "
sv,"but, that does not sit very well with a lot of folks, i am sure "
sv,there's some men out there that are more feminine than most women 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,right 
sv,"you know, neil, well neil as far as i am concerned, and i could be wrong about this, but the only one area where a woman could not do it is if she just physically did not have the strength,"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"uh, because, i would think, i think, you know, mentally, uh, and emotionally, i think women can handle a job and,"
aa,"oh, i do too"
%,so 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv," and, you know, if she wanted to go to combat,"
b,sure
sd,i personally would not want to go
%,"but , -"
aa,"no,"
sd,i would not either
aa,"no,"
sd,i agree
sd,"but i am sure that there are women who would, would relish that,"
b,"oh, yeah,"
b,yeah
sd,"so,"
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"so, well, this is an interesting topic,"
sd,"um, i have, you know, i have, -"
sd,"having a daughter who has gone into this, into engineering,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh 
sd,"she's a lot more forthright about her opinions and,"
ba,good
sv,"so, that's, that's progress, i guess "
b,yeah 
fc," well, i have enjoyed talking with you lisa,"
qy,"and,"
fc,"well, same here"
%,"or, -"
sd," well, i am not a home, at home a lot"
b,yeah

sd,"i put my work number,"
sd,"but, at home, uh, the recorder gets my calls"
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,"usually, i am not there,"
b,"right,"
sd,but i probably talked to seven or eight people
bk,"yeah,"
ba,"well,"
b,uh-huh
ba,that's good
sd,"i personally have not made any calls yet, myself,"
sd,"i,"
b,yeah
b,yeah

b,"yeah,"
ba,"well,"

b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, uh, so we are doing it to raise money for, uh, a large project at church,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, so i feel like this is one way i can contribute that's"
b,yeah
ba,that's wonderful

qy,"did you go cam-, take them camping?"
sd,that's when we camped the most
b,uh-huh
%,"when, -"
sv,"i thinks it's a marvelous activity for younger families because, uh,"
sd,"and, and getting out into nature and relaxing,"
b, uh-huh 
sd,"and the part that i did was more fun than, uh, than labor because they did the, the running and toting chores and i just helped cook and kind of organize, you know"
b,yeah
qy,"bu-, e-, even cooking over an open fire is a little more fun, isn't it"
na,"it is,"
^g,isn't it
ng,it isn't
qw,"ha-, what kinds of things have you tried?"
qy,"have you done, uh, uh, uh, the big pot cooking?"
no,"oh, oh, uh, well, it was really my ex who did the, the, uh, uh, the cooking back when we first started"
sd,"and we found that the, you know, what was one, one great handy things was this, uh, uh, uh, hamburger helper"
b,"oh, yeah"
sd," big frying p-, "
sd, you dumped everything in together
sd,"and it was enough for all five of us, six of us"
ba,"oh, that's interesting"
sd,"you know, interesting enough, uh, the food part was kind of, uh, important thing in our camping"
sd,"uh, when my oldest son, uh, -"
sd,always at the beginning i did all the shopping and everything
sd,"but the, the neat breakthrough was when my oldest son mark took his, uh, uh, cooking merit badge in,"
sd,"and, and mark was the kind of camper who ate beef stroganoff"
sd,"and, uh,"
b, oh 
sd,"and so, uh, after he took that merit badge, he did all the shopping and preparing, getting ready for it"
ba,well that's great
sd,"it was, it was a marvelous experience because after that, then all i had to do was, uh, follow the instructions, you know and do"
sd,and we did a lot of interesting kinds of things
sd,"like i would take corn bread and, uh, cook a pan inside of a pan over a, over a camp, uh, stove"
b,uh-huh
sd,and it works real good
sd,it's like an oven
sd," well, "
ad," just put, uh, put a thing on it"
h,i mean -
qw,what did you like to do most?
sd,well really just commune with nature
qy,that's neat isn't it?
sd,"we started out, uh, -"
sd,well we were living in florida at the time
sd,"and we, early in life, we discovered that six people all going on vacation gets to be very, very expensive"
aa,right
sd,i agree
sd,"so my ex decided, we're going to try camping"
sd,and she went out one day on the spur of the moment and bought a tent
sd,and that's how we got started
b, huh 
sd," we did it for years and years, uh"
qy,"well now in florida, is ther-, is there ti-, are there times of the year when it's very comfortable to camp or is it always kind of hot"
arp_nd,"well, ye-, uh,"
no,yes and no
sd,"i mean, um, ye-, in the winter time yes,"
sd,"it's, it gets kind of chilly or it can get chilly"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, there's really no time of the year that you can't go"
qy," oh, is that true? "

qy^d,"and you're in texas,"
^g,right
ny,"yes,"
sd,i'm in dallas
bk,"okay, uh,"
sd,"we have not camped a great deal here because, uh, a good share of the time in the summer time, it's too hot really to be very comfortable camping"
sd,"well, it just depends on where you go,"
sv,"for instance,"
%," i gue-, -"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,we have done that 
sd,"but, but we camped mostly, -"
sd,"when the kids were little we were in, we were in new jersey, and w-,"
sd,"it's just about twelve miles south of, the new york border"
sd,and we'd go up to the adirondacks and camp
sd,"and it was so, you know, pick your own, uh, blueberries and make blueberry pancakes for breakfast "
aa,"oh yes,"

b,"oh, oh yeah,"
sd,i know that
sd,"i had a cousin who lived in white plains,"
sv,"that's a, that's a neat area"
sv,"but it's a, that is a particularly neat area for camping because, -"
sd,well that i wouldn't know
sd,i left there when i was quite young
b,"yeah,"
sv,"it is neat though because there are lots of lakes, fairly near by,"
sd,you don't have to go very far
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, and there's, uh, a lot of trees, lot of mountains, and lot of, uh, hiking sort of things"
sd,"and, and we had, uh, collapsible boat which we, clipper, little clipper sail boat"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so we would sail and, and, uh, did a lot of camping that way"
sd,"well, uh, me, i outgrew, uh, sleeping bags and, uh, tents, -"
sd, and i now have a motor home
bh,"oh, do you"
sd,we've gotten out a time or two on a rented basis
sv,"and it's fun, too, i think"

aa,definitely 
%,"i'd always, -"
bf, nothing like the fresh outdoors 
aa," right,"

sd,"so it's, it's still green,"
sd,and it's been two days
sd,so i'm encouraged 
nn," no,"
sd,"i, i haven't had, had good luck with that company, uh,"
sv,"i think some of it depends how long things stay in the mail, probably"
b,yeah
sd,"but, i've had to, to get my money back from them and had better luck with, with some of the, the more expensive companies"
b,"yeah,"
%,"there's a, uh, -"

qy,do you have lowe's up there?

qy,"oh, they're bulbs for spring or fall?"
sd,"uh, probably spring,"
sd,"but, uh, i don't much care about things like that"
sd,"i'll, i'll make a little sort of greenhouse, a miniature greenhouse to put all this stuff in"
sd,"something, something, to keep me occupied, you see"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i'll, uh, buy some plastic and make a little house"
%,"and, -"
ba, cute
b,"yeah,"
sd,and watch the cats tear it up
b,right
sd,"i don't know that,"
qy,do cats bother bulbs?
sv,i think more the mice or other rodents
na,"they, they just like to get in and dig"
bk,"oh, i see"
bf,"so if you have fresh dirt, they'll , -"
sd,"oh, they love to dig"
sd,"i had, i had some, uh, -"
sd,"i don't know what kind they are,"
sd,"i've already forgotten, -"
sd,just regular old flower seeds
sd,and i planted them
sd,"and i was so, i was so thrilled because they came up, i mean nice green shoots coming up all over the place"
sd,and then my cats got into it and started digging and that took care of that
ba,"uh, gee"
sd,"so, i have to hang these things high, -"
sd,so they can't get to them
sd,especially the catnip
qw,how many cats do you have?
sd,three
bk,oh okay
sd,"actually i just, put a, uh, little fence around my yard, uh, um, which is i suppose, technically illegal,"
sd,"but i had so many groundhogs last year that i think they'll let me get by with it,"
sd,"and it, it's got this one inch mesh"
sd,and what i've noticed it's kept the cats out
sd,and i love it 
b,"um, yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"because they, they like to get in and fertilize things too"
qw,"but, uh, why would it be illegal?"
sd,"well, because we have these tow-, uh, -"
sd,i live in a townhouse
sd,and anyway all of our areas have associations that you have to get permission
b,"oh, uh, yeah,"
b,right
sv,"and, you know, they want, uh, privacy fences"
sv,"well, if nobody, yeah, if nobody complains you're all right"
b,"right,"
b,right
sd,"well they do walking tours too,"
%,so -
b,um
sv,"but at least, because i back up to, um, a hillside where the, uh, wild animals are, i think i can probably justify it"
b,"um, yeah,"
%,"an, -"
sv,and if somebody raises a stink about it you can always go before the association and argue your case anyway
b,"right,"
b,"right,"
%,"i me-, -"
sv,"you know, you don't have to put up with all these wild critters coming into your property"
b," right,"
sd,"the first year, the deer ate my garden,"
sd,and i was just astounded
sd,"i'm going deer, right here in the city "
b,"yeah,"
b^m,"right here, bambi "
aa, exactly
ba,"uh, gosh"
%,"and so, -"
^h,"well, let's see,"
sd,"other than gardening which i fiddle at, -"
sd,"i'm not very good at, -"
t1,"what else do i, mostly just computer stuff"
b,oh
sd,i just like playing with my computer and doing stuff on that
sd,"uh, cooking, that's not really a hobby,"
sv,it's a necessity
sd,"but, but i enjoy it"
sd,i like to think that i'm a very good cook
ba,"oh, great"
^h,"um, hobbies,"
sd,that's about it
sd,"i don't have much time for hobbies, uh, between being a student and trying to run a business on the side,"
sv,you don't have a lot of time
aa,right
sd,that keeps you busy
b,"yeah,"
sd,and raising cats
sd, i mean that could become a hobby
sd,"well, it's, it started out as a hobby actually"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, it just, it developed into sort of a business, uh, you know,"
sd,"we breed them and all that,"
sd,"but, we didn't, you know, we didn't really start it for the money,"
%,"it was just, -"
sd,they were fun to have around
sd,and we figured if we're going to have them we might as well have some purebreds an
sd,"and now it developed in to going to cat shows and finding studs for them, and, you know, all this kind of stuff"
b,uh-huh
qw,what kind of cats are they?
sd,"uh, i've got a, uh, a bombay, a turkish van and a himalayan persian"
ba,wow
b,"yeah,"
sd,the himie is probably the sweetest one
sd,"she's, she's just a little sweetheart"
%,"we, uh, -"
sd,"the, the bombay had a litter, uh, last october"
%,"and w-, -"
sd,"i just got her back from the vet this morning, getting her spayed"
sd,only going to breed them once
b,"oh, okay"
sd,"and, uh, she's not, she's not feeling too great today"
qy,"um, is that typical, to only breed them once?"
nn,"no,"
sv,"uh, m-, most breeders are in it for the money,"
sd,"so they'll bree-, they'll breed them twice a year"
sv,"and i,"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"you know, they just, they just breed these, they breed them before they're ready,"
sv,"uh, and,"
b,right
sv,"and, and they, they do a lot of inbreeding too,"
sv,"and so you end up with, you know, kind of strange kittens"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and i just don't like that
qy,"so will, you, uh, breed one of the litter, then next year?"
ng,"we're, we sold all that litter,"
b,oh
%,"um, we, -"
sd,"there's not that much call to, for bombays"
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, they're, they're registered"
sd,"but they're not, they're not, uh, they're not show cats"
b,"oh, i see"
sd,"uh, so all you can do is sell them as pet quality"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, so what you've got is a registered pet"
sv,"and, not too many people want bombays"
sv,they want things like himie persians and turkish vans
b,uh-huh
sv,"turkish vans, if you've never seen one, i mean, you wouldn't know that it was a pure bred"
sd,"it's just, uh, medium size short hair cat"
%,"it's got, -"
sd,"he's mostly white with, uh, brown and black patches"
b,oh
sd,but they have nice personalities
sd,and they're very inquisitive
sd,"um, now the himie, we'll probably breed her a couple of times"
sd,"and we'll, we'll end up keeping one out of each litter and then breeding those"
b,right
sd,"it's just the stud fees are so much, though"
sd,it'll cost about three hundred dollars for a stud for her
sd,"we, we want to breed her with a champion,"
%,so -
b,right
qy^d,now these are long haired?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"the persian is,"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and the other two are short hairs
b,right
ba,"uh, that's nice"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"she's, uh, she's sweet"
sd,"going to have some nice kittens, i hope"
b,uh-huh
%,"she's, uh, she's, -"
sd,"if yo-, if you know what a himalayan is, generally they look something like, uh, -"
sd,well they come in a lot of different colors
sv,people don't realize it
sv,"but they're sort of like, uh, siamese in a way"
sd,"they have the, uh, they have the gloves on the paws"
sd,"and they're, they're usually two colored"
%,"uh, but this one is, uh, is -"
sd,"she's, pre-, predominantly, uh, black"
sd,"but she has chocolate, uh, paws, chocolate stomach and silver on her hindquarters"
ba,gee
b,"and yeah,"
sd,"she's, she's quite attractive looking"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"hope, hope the stud will find her attractive"
sd, and that she has kittens that look like her
sd,"and, and that she has a whole bunch of kittens"
sd,"but we have to be careful,"
sd,"uh, you know, we have to get a particular color point, uh, stud"
sv,you can't just breed them with anything
sd,"we have to get a, uh, we have to get a silver point himie,"
sd,so that the silver will be predominate in the kittens
b,i see
sd,"that's, it, that's the fun part, trying to figure out what you've got to breed them with,"
sd,"can't just go out there and say, okay, you guys breed, you know "
sv," you can't just tell them that anyway,"
%,but -
aa,that's right
ba,oh dear
sv,"well it really sounds like, uh, uh, a business more than a hobby"
aa,"well actually, i mean, it, it is a business in a way,"
sd,"but it, it's a lot of fun as a hobby especially when you go to shows and get to see all the different cats"
sd,"we're, we're about to get another breed,"
sd,"we're go-, we're going to buy a devon rex "
sd,"and i didn't, i don't like devon rexes at first"
qw,what is it
sd,"it's a, well actually it's a mutant"
sd,"it, it comes from england and, uh, fr-, in the county of devon"
b,oh
sd,and it's a mutant cat
sd,"and they're, they're pretty expensive,"
sd,"we're going to, we're going to shell out probably about a thousand bucks for one"
sd,"um, they're very thin,"
sd,"they're, they're, they're long and lanky and skinny"
b,um
sd,and they have real short hair
sd,"it's curly, as a matter of fact"
ba,"huh, interesting"
b,"um, yeah,"
sd,"it, it, it's a strange looking cat"
sd,"uh, i didn't like them at first"
sd,"they've got great big ears,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
qy^d, he did really decide to go?
aa,"uh-huh,"
aa,sure
sd,"i'm familiar with it,"
sd,and it was a very difficult choice
qy,"and he, well, he must know, is he interested in law or medicine,"
qy^d,he must have a definite profession in mind
bk,"oh, okay,"
sd,"medium size,"
^g,aren't they?
qy,is he excited?
sd,"very excited,"
ba,"wow,"
%,"i can,"
%,"i, -"
b,uh-huh
sd,"while they're east coast, i mean, i don't know anything about their football,"
h,but there you go
sd,"well, they're, they're, they're really very strong academic rather than, you know, big sports,"
b,"yeah,"
%,"that's, -"
qw,"where, where you at?"
sd,"we're outside of, uh, washington in maryland"
qo,how about you?
bk,"oh, okay,"
sd,"i'm in, uh, suburban dallas"
b,"uh-huh,"
qy,"do you have children in, -"
nn,"no,"
sd,"i don't,"
sd,i have a husband 
sd,we don't have any kids yet
b,"okay, um,"
sv,"about all i can say is i guess about picking schools, um, i guess, uh, if you don't know what you're going to do, liberal arts program is a good idea"
%,"well, i, i, -"
sd,"one of the, the advices we've given our children is that you can always learn a job "
aa,"this is true,"
sd," uh, but what you can't learn, uh, on a job, is a good solid well-, well-rounded education"
aa,"right,"
bf,"the humanities, the history, yeah,"
aa,"that's right, you know,"
sd,the renaissance man 
aa,"right,"
aa,"right,"
%,"no,"
%,"no,"
%,no 
sv," and, uh, and if you get that you can,"
sv,"and if you do well, you can, you can learn a job,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"but they, you know, if they learn the job and they can go into graduate school "
aa,that's exactly right
aa,that's right
%,"and, -"
sd,so the advice we gave to them 
b,uh-huh
aa,"this, this is true,"
b,yes
^2,"and if you want to go away,"
^g,"right,"
^q," do you want to go away,"
^q,how far from home do you want to be
b,right
^q,what do you want in a college
sd,now my son is a national level competitive swimmer 
ba,good
sd," so he wanted to swim in school,"
sd,but he did not want to be in a swim factory
b,okay
bf,"so he wouldn't have gone to something like where we're at, they'd, in austin, texas, university of texas,"
aa,"that's right,"
sd,"that's the university of texas at austin, or "
b,right
b^m,"texas aqua-, -"
b,"yeah,"
b,"okay,"
sd,"well that's, i think the other thing is, too, um, i know i went to a, uh, city high school in chicago "
b,uh-huh
sd," and a lot of the kids weren't as fortunate as say, my brother and i were,"
sd,and economics was the choice 
b,uh-huh
sv," um, sounds like your son has academically the standing to get into that type of school"
sd,"he is very, very strong academically,"
%,"yeah,"
%,"so, we've just, -"
sd,"but, you know, he had to look to see "
b,uh-huh
sd,"and yet he, he did wind up having to make a choice"
sd,"he did apply to a large, you know, large group,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"university of penn, -"
sd,i'm originally from pennsylvania
sd,"pennsyl-, university of pennsylvania, -"
sd,it's got about nine thousand undergraduate
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"that's strong,"
%,i mean that's 
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sv," and it's, it's, well, it's a little bit, i don't want to use the word wilder, that's not the word i want um, more diverse ,"
aa,"yes,"
sd,"and it, but it does have the under, you know, -"
sd,"that's total undergraduate with five hundred graduate school, so that the, uh, the college of arts and sciences is, you know, i guess about four thousand"
qy,at williams or pennsylvania?
qy,"at williams, -"
sd,at pennsylvania
b^m,at pennsylvania
qw,well how large is williams?
sd,williams is an undergraduate school only 
b,right
sd," um, and it's a total of two thousand"
ba,well that's not bad
aa,"yeah,"
sd,so he knew the feeling because my other son is at amherst which is 
^2,"which is a lot, -"
b,yeah
sd, and he had visited his brother at amherst and knew 
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd," but he did go on college visits,"
sd,"and he liked, -"
sv,"that's the thing to do,"
sd,"i mean, i, not having any children, my husband was an ohio state person,"
sd,"and, uh, that has something like either the first or second largest student population, like fifty thousand"
aa,"yes,"
aa,yes 
sd,combined -
sv," it's large,"
sd,"and they, both boys had decided no, that they did not want that"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"that is too much,"
sv,"and i mean, i, um, i can only say it's strange your son picked those kinds of college because i spent a year at bennington in vermont,"
%,"oh, it's, -"
%,"so you, -"
sd,"um, and that was, this was twenty years ago "
b,uh-huh
sd,"showing my age, -"
qy,and did you ever eat at the blue bin diner?
ny,yes
ba,"oh my god,"
qw,"where are you from,"
ad,"well, let's not talk about that "
aa, no
sd,but we've been there when whose gone up there -
sd,"it's, um, in that area"
sd,i mean i just can't say enough about it
sd,"oh, it's, it -"
sd,we went
sd,"and he was, you know, impressed by the clean air"
sd,"and he, he met the students at both schools"
sd,and he liked them
sd,"well you know, um, my husband's an engineer and a strong , a strong liberal arts background with, uh, a graduate degree in a technical field "
b,uh-huh
aa,that's it
sv,"the thing is if, if a person really knows very early on "
b,uh-huh
^2,"and they usually,"
sv, but they usually don't 
sv,"but, uh, for, if you're going into, -"
sv,"if you know engineering is the thing if, then you've got to at least take engineering"
aa,"right,"
sd,"but they, -"
%,no
qh,but who does
sv,"i mean, i think,"
aa, that's right 
%,no
sd,"he looked at criteria such as location, size of school "
b,uh-huh
%,no
sd,"he didn't apply to any school further,"
sd,"the furthest away was bowdoin, in maine which is about twelve hours"
sv,that's still pretty far though
sv,"i mean a lot of kids just don't even want to go,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,that was the furthest and then kenyon in ohio which was about six and a half hours
sd,and williams is about seven
ba,"oh, that's not too bad"
aa,yeah
%,"so, well, i mean he, so it wasn't, -"
%,"he, you know, -"
sd,then the university of pennsylvania is like two hours from here by train
sd,and then bucknell in mid-state pennsylvania
b," yeah,"
sv,"he will enjoy williams i think and is a good academic,"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"and he will,"
sd,"and if, it came down i mean, as he, he came, -"
sd,he's been talking to them
sd,"and,"
sd,"and one of the things that he said is, he went to pennsylvania this weekend"
sd,and he had an absolutely marvelous time 
b,uh-huh
sd, he had a great time
sd,"but then he said, you know, it was such a good time that i almost got the feeling that their emphasis is on having fun"
sv,that could very well be
sv,"and,"
sd,"and he said it almost back-, -"
sd,i think it backfired
sv,that's good because 
%,so -
sd,"well actually that's one of the reasons i went to , -"
sv,"kenyon, he we-, he made a good choice"
sd,"i went, -"
sd,"i, well i was supposed to,"
sd,"but i spent a year in vermont, my freshman year,"
sd,"it was just too far away,"
sd,it was too different 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and their attitudes was just, um, beyond my,"
b," yeah,"
b,yeah 
sv,"of course, that period too was probably difficult"
aa,"right,"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,you're right
sd,"but then i went, -"
sd,"but i did, uh,"
sd,"my advice to him,"
b,yeah
sd,he had to look at himself
sd,"uh, in a larger school he had to realize that if he was going to screw around it, he could probably slip"
sd,and it wouldn't be caught up until it was too late where in a smaller school 
b,uh-huh
sd,and you're going to get a little bit more input than 
%,"that's, -"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,yeah
%,yeah
sd,"and a swim coach is going to be right on top of you, uh, so that,"
sd,"and he will know the professors in a small, -"
h,well i don't know how to put this either in this way
sv,and then it doesn't sound like your sons would need this
sv,"but i just think the other thing is with the way a lot of the youth is today, i think the refinement that they get "
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
aa,"that's right,"
aa,that's right
%,"and, um, -"
sd,"and, um, and it's just the personal contact where if you need help -"
aa,that's right
%," he had, -"
sd,i told him to look to yourself
^q,are you the kind of person that will go into a large college and if the professor says i've got office hours but you really don't feel that you know him because you're in a class of a hundred 
b, right 
b,yeah
^q, but if it's a class of fifteen 
sv,"this is very, very, -"
b,oh
sd, and even though they may break it up into smaller groups penn is known for having 
^2, they have video lectures 
b,yeah
b^m, video lectures 
sd, they have graduate assistants to teach the smaller groups
aa,"this is true,"
sv,"and i mean that is very ironic too that your son just made the, -"
qy,did he just make the decision today?
sd," he made the decision, uh, i'd say, about, uh, an hour and a half ago "
ba,how funny 
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"i mean, that's so funny i mean,"
sd,"and, and, in fact, he had just an hour before that two, uh, recent graduates from kenyon spent close to two hours talking with him "
ba,that's funny
sd," and, uh, i mean, and he, they were really nice,"
sd,"and, but he said is, that they didn't tell him anything that he didn't know,"
sd,but they helped confirm his decision that a smaller school was better
bf,it was easy for him to rule out
bf,he knew what he didn't want -
aa,"yeah,"
aa,yeah
sv," that's exactly, -"
%,yeah
qy,"now is your other, -"
sd,"i mean we're talking about what you think,"
sd,"but obviously you're experiencing it uh,"
qy,"did your other son, um, -"
sd,my other son is just as happy as a bed bug
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",a clam
%,"he, -"
sd,"the moment he knew, he, he decided early on that amherst was the school"
sd,he's a classical guitarist 
ba,"oh, wonderful"
sd," and he decided, he also got into the graduate school of music as an undergraduate "
b,uh-huh
sd,"but he decided he was going to go to the, um "
^2,"the smaller and the, -"
sv,"and they'll do fine in their studies,"
sv,"and i'm sure they'll go on to graduate school,"
sd,"well, he's really, my older boy's real happy,"
sd,"and he's minoring in english,"
sd,"and he had thought about economics,"
sd,"and he took a couple of courses in economics and decided that wasn't, -"
qrr,or is this early admissions?
sd,"he's, um, he's going to be a junior"
sd,"he'll be, he's finishing his sophomore year "
bf,"so he's,"
sv,well sounds like you have two talented sons
sd,"well, you know, see the advice we give is to not limit yourself, especially this, you know, go to a school where you're not forced to make too many irrevocable decisions your first year or two"
sv,"i think, and a lot of people talk about, -"
sd,"and it's not the economics i solely zeroed in on,"
sv,but i think a lot of people think a lot of people think about the tuition level and what exactly are you getting in return 
b,yeah
sv," and i think that a lot of people shy away from the smaller coll-, colleges because of that,"
sv,"and i think it's rather sad,"
sd,"well, one of the things we said is that they should pick the college,"
sd,"this was our advice, too, irrespective of the cost that somehow we would manage"
sv,you are wonderful parents 
sd,"well, we place a real high priority on education in our family"
b,"no,"
aa,"and i agree,"
sd,"i mean, my husband and i, -"
sd,"in fact, i'm taking my l s a t -s, um,"
sd,i'm thirty something 
ba,"oh, good,"
ba,that's wonderful
ba,"oh, that's great"
sv,"the point being, and your sons will learn this from you, i'm sure, that, uh, no matter what age you are, you can learn "
aa,"that's right,"
aa,"that's exactly, -"
sv," and, it sounds like they're going to, you know, they're, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay 
ad, i'll let you go ahead 
aa,okay
sd,"i, uh, i have five children all together"
b,"oh, uh-huh"
sd,"uh, my oldest two are already out and about in the world"
sd,"and i, uh, have a set of twins that are fourteen "
b,oh
sd," and, uh, my youngest is twelve"
ba,that's great
sd,i always thought it'd be great to have twins
b,"uh, yeah"
sv,if you like doing everything twice 
b,"well, yeah"
sd,"uh, at any rate, um, my first two children, uh, i didn't spend a whole lot of time with them"
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, and, you know, was a, a problem with having five children needing to work a, uh, a full-time job that,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"i,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, so i didn't get to spend as much time with them as i, as i should have, as i really wanted to"
qy,"your first ones you mean, it,"
ny,yeah
%,"the, -"
ny,"yeah,"
%,"the f-, -"
sd,"well, it was with all of them,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but it was, uh, more an impact, i think, on the oldest two"
b,uh-huh
sd,"because, um, oh, about the time i got out of working that long hours was when the, uh, when the twins were about three years old"
sd,"and, uh, they never, you know, i don't think they noticed i wasn't around that much"
b,oh
sd,"you know, with all the children around the house, it's,"
b,right
sd," um, so, what i've tried to do, uh, now that i've, uh, fi-, -"
sd,went back to school and got my degree when i was thirty years old
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, uh, so, then i came out and was making as much money forty hours a week as i did fifty-one hours,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, i've tried to spend more time with, uh, the children since then"
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, what i'm currently doing is, uh, taking a lot of time"
sd,i'm helping the kids more with their homework in the evenings
sd,"um, we just started a thing where every other week we go to, uh, movies"
sd,there's a movie theater that offers dollar movies on wednesday nights
b,uh-huh
sd,"and so, every couple of weeks we will go to the movies because that's how often they change the,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, it's working out pretty well"
sd,"um, we're spending more time together"
sd,i feel like i'm a lot closer to the three that are still living at home than i ever was to the two that were living there before
b,uh-huh
sd,"um, in fact, i found that i'm a lot closer with, uh, -"
sd,i have one son who's gone
sd,and i don't even know where he's at
b,huh
sd,"um, he's taken off for parts unknown,"
ba,that's difficult
aa,"but, uh, yeah"
b,yeah
%,"a-, -"
sd,"and, uh, my daughter is, um, has moved out of the house"
sd,her and i get along a lot better now that she's moved out of the house 
b,uh-huh
sd, it happens that way 
sd,"and uh, so it's, it's, it's, it's been difficult to try to find the time,"
sd,"and i think it's important that we do, because, uh, i notice that, uh, when i had spent two years down in dallas, down there they all have a, uh, a me kind of attitude"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and i noticed parents not spending time with their,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, you know, i knew like the kids next door were all into cocaine"
%,"and,"
b,"um, uh-huh"
sd,"i saw the family falling apart down,"
sv,"texas is,"
sv,"i mean, it was bad enough every place else,"
sd,"but drugs is, in texas, are extremely bad"
b, yeah
sd,"and so, i think it's kind of important that i, that i, you know, nurture the relationship i have with my children now"
b,uh-huh
sd,and i'm doing my best 
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, that's all you can do"
b,yeah
qw,"what's your, been your experience?"
qy,"well, i, i was going to ask, too, does your wife work?"
na,"um, she didn't up until the last, oh, six months"
b,uh-huh
%,um
qy^d,she just recently started working then
na," she just recently,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, she worked a job until we moved to our new house"
sd,"and, uh, she quit that job because it was too inconvenient"
sd,"and,"
b,uh-huh
b,"oh, uh-huh"
b,uh-huh
ba,"so, that sounds great"
sd," well, uh, we also have five children"
b,huh
sd,"and, but ours are all out of the nest "
sd,"so, uh, as, when they were growing up, i, probably we had a lot of similar things l-, like you had, you know, having the time"
sv,"when you have younger ones to take care of, you maybe sometimes do not take as much time for the older ones"
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, we were, we're very active, of course, at church, and, uh, boy scouting, and girl scouts, four h, uh,"
sd,"and those activities helped a lot in,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and uh, we try to take a vacation with them every year, camping of some sort, something that wasn't expensive"
sd,"and, uh, our youngest is, uh, expecting her first baby"
sd,"so, they're, they're all out and on their own"
%," they're, -"
sd,and we have one to get married yet 
sd,and they'll all be married
sd,"uh, and they're, they're all doing pretty good"
%,"they, uh, -"
qy^d," t lives in pittsburgh, you probably don't know where that is"

sd,he works right on the border of d c
b,uh-huh
sd,and one lives in connecticut <<tape skips on speaker a's section>>
sd,"and our baby lives just a mile over the hill ,"
b,yeah
ba,that sounds great
sd,"i've, i've noticed, uh, another thing, um, when i was younger my father was always working"
b,uh-huh
sd,"well,"
%,"and, -"
b,yeah
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, you know, he, uh, he worked a full-time job and a part-time job,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and i never saw him
b,uh-huh
sd,"so, i didn't have much of a role model to go by"
^2,"to go, to follow"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sv,and that does make a big difference
aa,yeah

sd,"i'm kind of old fashioned, i guess, that way"
b,yes
sd,"but they seem to, they seem to give, uh, quality time to those children when they are together"
sd,"and, and so, it seems, it seems for them that it works out all right"

qw,how do you get your news mostly?
sd," generally, i get most of my news from, uh, the radio"
sd,"and then sometimes, uh, if i've got time, i'll be reading the front page of the newspaper "
b,"uh-huh,"
b, uh-huh 
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, also, since my wife likes to watch t v, sometimes, uh, ju-, having b-, just being there i get, uh, you know, i have to watch the news late at night "
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
qo,how about you?
sd,"well, i can hardly wait for my morning paper to come"
b,uh-huh
sd,so that's the first thing i want is the headlines
sd,"it's really funny because because, uh, uh, my sister grabs the sports and i grab the headlines "
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, and then when five o'clock comes around i just want to get in the house and turn the t v on to watch the news"
%,um
sv,it's really weird
sd,"uh, i don't stay up late to watch late news because my eyes won't stay up that long"
sd,"but, uh, i love to watch the five o'clock news"
sd,"and i, makes me angry when my paper boy's not there on time where i can read my paper "
%,um
sd,"uh, i do have my radio going most of the day though,"
sd,"so about every hour it breaks in and gives me news too, you know"
b,okay
qy, do you

nn,no
nn,uh-huh *listen; mistranscribed 'uh-uh'
sd,"jus-, i just have a channel that has music except for, like every hour, you know, say eight o'clock, nine "
b, sure 
b,right
sd,"but as far as the actual news, i get that from <<sounds like a call waiting>> from the, -"
qy,can you hold on just for a second?
na,sure
ad,just a minute

fp,yes
fp,"yes,"
fa,i'm sorry to keep you waiting 
bd, okay 
sd,"uh, i was calling from work"
sd,so and that was a call waiting
b,right
sv,"s-, it sounds like you, uh, like the news a lot more than i do"
sv,"me, i figure if it's something really important, somebody will tell me about it"
sd,"but, uh, you know, i, the thing is if, if i catch the news all the time, it just makes me depressed because they tend to produce a lot of bad news"
sd, or that's what 
b," yeah,"
%,"yo-, -"
aa,that's true too
sd,"and, uh, you know, also late at night, you know, i don't wa-, like watching the news late at night"
sd,but my wife is usually up then 
sd,and so 
b, uh-huh 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
%,"i, uh, -"
sd,"but, you know, i, i wish i had, uh, more news on things like, that i consider long range things like science and medicine "
b,uh-huh
sd," uh, i'm more, i guess i'm more into science and science fiction"
%,"and, uh, there's, you know, -"
h,"not that the news is science fiction,"
sd,"but, uh, uh, i'm more interested in that"
sd,"things like, uh, is nasa ready for another space shot uh, you know, how hot are they on the trail of a cure for such and such cancer "
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, uh, you know, a lot of the news isn't that interesting to me"
b,yeah
sv,"well, you're right"
sv,"there is a lot of it that's, that's just garbage, as far as i'm concerned, you know"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but i just like the, more or less, the, the daily news, you know"
b,yeah
sd,i like that 
sd," me, too "
sv,although they're usually wrong 
aa," yeah,"
sv,"georgia here, they're usually wrong too"
sv,we have weird weather systems
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, uh, like i say, as far as, as actually listening to the news, it's mostly t v, five o'clock to six thirty"
sv,"uh, that seems like a long time for news"
sd,but that's how long it is
b,yeah
sd,"and, uh, seems like they have the local news and they have the world news"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and then, uh, my morning paper i can hardly wait for it to come"
b,yeah
%, i'm 
%," and, uh, -"
sd,"i, i, i'm not a morning person"
sd,so i would begrudge the time it takes me in the morning to catch my morning news

sd,and then at work 
b, oh 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,right
sd,"once you get to work, i wouldn't either,"
aa,huh-uh
b,no <<very faint>>
sd,"but i've always been a morning person to get up, you know"
b,uh-huh
sd,"an-, but i can't stay up late at night to watch the late news"
sd,so i guess that's why i watch it at five o'clock 
b, yeah
fc,"but anyhow well, listen, i guess that's about it then"
fc,okay
fc,it's been nice talking to you tony
fc,nice talking to you
sv,i'll probably talk to you again
sd,i had a friend who was in this
sd,and he said that he got calls from the same caller sometimes
bh,"oh, really?"
ny,yeah
sd,"oh, well that hasn't happened to me yet"
h,"so, you never know,"
sv,it might this time
aa,that's right
fc," okay, tony"
fc,take it easy
fc,uh-huh
fc, bye-bye 
fc, bye-bye 
^h,"let's see, *something missing? a1?"
sd,"my husband does the majority of the, um, the, uh, gardening, uh, taking care of the lawn and fertilizing,"
sd,"but, i, um, tend to all the, planting the annuals and, and the spraying "
b,uh-huh
sd,"i'll fix the porch up with pumpkins for halloween and christmas,"
sd,"but basically he does all the heavy stuff,"
sd,and i do all the fun stuff 
sd," well, we have it just opposite here"
sd,"my wife works in, you know, at, at, at the t i,"
sd,"and she's, uh, sedentary all day long "
b,uh-huh
b,i see
sd,"and we have about ten acres,"
sd,and she tries 
ba,wow
ba,"wow that's a, a big job"
aa,"well, yeah,"
%,"it keeps, uh, well, -"
sd,"it's doing real well,"
sd,"because when we got this place the, the dirt was just overgrazed "
b,uh-huh
sd," i mean, you know, it was bare dirt in a lot of places "
b,uh-huh
sd," and now, you know, since we've been mowing it, -"
sd,"and, you know, of course we water a little bit,"
sd,"that's just too much to water all at once,"
sd,but 
ba,"oh, sure"
ba,"oh, i bet it's beautiful"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"but we don't do much in the way of, uh, flowers"
sd,we have one little flower garden 
b,uh-huh
sd,the rest of it is just like wild flowers 
b^m,wild flowers
sd, and in the summertime we get the prettiest yellow flowers
b,uh-huh
sd,"they're about, oh, i guess, a third the size of your, palm of your hand "
b,uh-huh
sd, and 
ba,"oh, that sounds lovely"
b,uh-huh
sv,"oh, the wild flowers are beautiful"
sd,"i think, um, i was thinking about throwing some for, in the back, just where the kids, um, just way in the back, behind the swing sets"
sd,"or, just have some wild flowers growing back there would be real pretty"
qy^d,then you don't really have to have much maintenance involved
ny,yeah
sd,"well, my wife and i really enjoy that sort of thing"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, she enjoys mowing"
sd,i can't believe it
b,"uh-huh,"
sd, i know a lot of -
sd," i mean, i hate it "
b," uh-huh,"
sd,"a lot of women do um,"
sd,"i've just never really, you know, -"
sd,"maybe one of these days i'll have to get out there and mow,"
sd,"but, um, my husband takes it on,"
sd,"and i'll help rake up the grass,"
sd,"and, um, sometimes i'll help him edge, um,"
sd,"because, we don't have that much property,"
sd,"but we're on a corner lot,"
sd,so there's a lot of edging to do 
b,right
sv," and, um, uh, that's what's nice about living more in the country,"
sv,you don't have to worry about any of that 
sd, we don't even have any concrete 
b,oh
ba,"oh, that's nice,"
%,"i, -"
sd,"this is different for us because the other, -"
sd,"in the past we've had homes that haven't had any side walks,"
sd,"and, um, it's been a little more country with the trees,"
sd,and we do miss that
sd,"um, if we had a chance to move, i think we'd move back to somewhere that was a little more countrified "
b,uh-huh
b,yeah 
sd," but, you know, we do everything together"
b,uh-huh
sd,"this, this spring we got a thousand pine trees from the, -"
sd,"actually this fall, i was talking about, -"
sd,two weeks ago 
b,oh
b,uh-huh
sd," and, uh, we're in the process of, of planting "
ba,"wow that's, -"
sd," and we're building a stand, uh, just to the north of our house, and along the east, uh, property line "
b,um
sd," and i, uh, i think what we're, what we're trying to do is create sort of a wind break "
b,uh-huh
b,right
%,so -
b,right
%," well, i put, -"
sd," on the other side of the house, though, that's where we have all the, the delicate flowers and the mums,"
sd,and we have morning glory 
b,uh-huh
sd," and we have trumpet vine and moon flowers,"
sd,"and we planted those out by the septic, so that, uh, they get plenty of water "
b,uh-huh
sd, and we get hummingbirds come in the 
b,oh
ba,"oh, that sounds so pretty"
sd,"and, well, when we leave the doors open, they fly in the house"
ba,oh really 
qy^d,"do they, don't do any damage, though,"
qy^d,"they just fly right back out, if you have the, -"
ny,"well, yeah,"
sd,they don't like it in here because there's nothing to eat 
ba,i see
sd," and when you're as busy as one of those babies, you've got to eat most of the time"
b,i see
sd,"and we got a few, you know,"
sd,we put up some hummingbird feeders and some bird feeders
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, you know, for the most part, gardening for us is, -"
sd,"well, we got asparagus,"
sd,"and, uh, we've got some plum trees and some apple trees and some tomato "
b,uh-huh
sd,"man, we get the best strawberries, that you just can't believe"
ba,"oh, oh, that sounds wonderful"
sd,we just got our last tomatoes
ba,"oh, i love home gro-, grown tomatos"
aa,yeah
sv,there's nothing like them
sv,they just don't have the same ones in the supermarket 
sd,"well, these are accidental tomatos"
qw,"what does that mean, accidental tomatoes?"
sd,"well, last year the birds came and ate a few of the tomatoes,"
sd,of course you're going to lose some that way 
b,uh-huh
sd, and the seeds go right through them
b,i see
sd,"and wherever they pooped, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",okay
sd,"um, i guess if i had to rate it from one to ten, i guess,"
sv,"and i think there should be limitations of, like semiautomatics"
sv,"uh, things like that should not be just given out to anybody"
sv,"in fact, you know, i can't imagine anybody having a semiautomatic for what purpose"
sv,"uh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,those would be fine
sd,"but when you get into a, a lot of the more complex weapons, i would say yes"
sv,we need to put restrictions on them 
aa," uh, that's pro-, i probably would have to agree with you pretty much all the way i think"
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, i definitely think that there, some things shouldn't be limited like, like you said, rifles and "
b,uh-huh
aa," exactly,"
sv," for self-protection,"
aa,sure
aa,right
sv,"and, but i think the, i think semiautomatic weapons, people say they use them because it, for sport"
sv,"but i, i personally cannot see any use for them "
ba, i can't imagine that
aa,yeah 
b,uh-huh
sv,"to do massive amounts of killing, uh,"
aa,right
%, and 
b, yeah 
sv," the only thing that i can see is the police having it in a case where somebody is, uh, uh, you know, going to kill a massive amount of people or, uh, somebody that's escaping, that's, uh, very dangerous "
b, uh-huh
sv," semiautomatic would allow more rounds to be put out to hopefully catch the person and, and, uh, get him down"
b,right
sd,"but, uh, you know, i, i think of my family"
sd,"uh, they're very much into sporting and, uh, you know, as far as hunting and also like, uh, clay pigeons "
b,right
b,uh-huh
sd,so they have may have some shotguns
sd,"they may have other type of, uh, hunting type things,"
sv,"but i figured if the, if the criminals had to take a hunting gun out to kill somebody, more than likely, somebody would see it, you know what i'm saying "
aa," right,"
aa,yeah 
aa," yeah,"
aa,that's true
sv,"and nobody would see it,"
sv,"but yet, you can't stop people from having, you know, a handgun in their home"
b,right
sv,"even if there are small children around, there's, you know,"
b,uh-huh
sv," and people without small children that may have grandchildren, you know "
b, yeah 
sd,but 
b,right
b,right
sd,"uh, you know, and i don't know if that makes a difference if the parent sets down to them and say this gun can kill you, you know "
b, uh-huh 
b, right
sd,"uh, so i don't know if that makes a difference or what"
%,"but, -"
sv,"well, i think par-, uh, in that ca-, i think that cases like that it's definitely, um, i think if you're to say okay,"
sv,we have to get rid of them all because 
b,uh-huh
sv, the criminals would get them i mean even if they had to go across border to get them 
aa," right,"
aa,right
sv," and people who, people who have them and are responsible with them are, are, are being punished"
sv,and people who 
b,uh-huh
^2," how to use, you know, to make sure the guns are put up as something as "
b, right 
b,right 
b,yeah
sd,because we had guns all over our house when we were kids 
b,uh-huh
sd," and not that they were laying on the, uh, couch or anything like that "
b,right
sd," but, uh, i never had an interest in them,"
b,uh-huh
sd, and i had four brothers and never messed with any type of guns 
b,right
sd, and so it was kind of the idea that we knew that a gun could kill and that a gun wasn't a toy 
b,right
sd," and, of course , we were quite young"
sd,"and we went through,"
b,uh-huh
sd," and so we were taught, you know, kind of at a, a good age, ten and eleven and twelve, to sit down with a kid and say okay,"
^q,"if you're going to learn how to shoot a gun, you're going to learn how to do it correctly"
^q,and you're going to learn how to have safeguards and 
b,uh-huh
sv,"but yet have this,"
sv,they have to have a certain respect for it
aa,right
sd,"well i think, i mean we, i grew up in a family"
sd,"and, and my father had two guns "
b,uh-huh
sd, because he used to hunt years ago
sd,but 
b,sure
b,uh-huh
sd,"but, and i knew we had the guns in the house"
sd,"and, th-, the time my father was keeping them just for protection at the time "
b,"sure,"
b,yeah
sd," but we, it was never, my brothers, sisters nor i never, i mean none of us ever thought well let's go look at the gun"
sd,or let's go get the gun
sd, it was just something you knew was there 
b,yes
sd," and th-, it was your father's"
sd,"and y-, you, that was not something you'd go and play, played with at all "
b,yeah
sv," and i think maybe, uh, and that's the type of, the thing that should be, you know, stressed "
aa," yeah,"
aa,i think so
sd,"an-, and i don't know if the kids nowadays are different than what , -"
qw,where have you been on a wonderful vacation?
sd," well normally when we go on vacation we go home, to colorado"
sd,"oh, that's where we go home, too"
b,really
b,"yeah,"
sd,colorado springs is where we're from
sd,that's where we go
ba, how funny
aa,"yes,"
sd,my husband's family lives just off of academy boulevard at maize land
bh,really?
ny,yes
sd,"we live up, up, uh, lake, in the broadmoor area "
%,uh
sd," that's where my fam-, my in-laws are"
sd,"oh, we've been there"
sd,we haven't skied at broadmoor
sd,we went there last year at christmas time
sd,and it was twenty-seven below
b,oh
sd,so we had to cancel our ski lessons 
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,as of you can't even ski there anymore
bh,really?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,they closed it down
qy,"oh, just this year?"
ny,uh-huh 
ba,"oh, my, -"
sd, they don't have enough money 
%,uh
sd,"it doesn't, doesn't pay"
%,so -
sv,"so that wouldn't be a good spot to go on a vacation, now "
ar,well 
sv,now colorado springs is real accessible to lake breckenridge 
b,uh-huh
sd, it's only a couple of hours away
sv,"and, uh, so, it's, it might not be too bad if you want to go skiing somewhere else"
sd,"but, you can't, can't ski up there any more"
b,no
sd,"oh, i'd like to go on vacation"
sd,"i c-, my husband and i want to go to florida "
b,uh-huh
sd,but we have two little ones 
b,yes
sd,so we want to wait until they're a little bit older 
b,oh
%,"and, -"
sd,"well, we went on a family cruise last year, on the premier family cruise line "
sd,and then we went to disney
sd,it was all part of the package
b,oh
sd,"and on the cruise ship they had mickey and minnie and chip and dale and goofy and donald duck,"
sd,and it was really oriented toward little kids
ba,"well, how fun"
sd,"so the kids could eat with chip and dale, you know,"
sv,"and, you know "
b,"oh yeah,"
ba,"oh, i bet"
sd,"so then we were on the cruise for three days in the bahamas,"
sd,and then landed at cape canaveral and then drove over to orlando and spent four days at disney
ba,"wow,"
ba,"well that sounds pretty,"
b,"yes,"
sv,that was the way to travel
aa,yes
qy^d,and it was all a big package deal 
ny,yes
na,that's right
na,"that's right,"
sd,"and kids are really cheaper, too"
b,really
sd,"we really lucked out because the ship we were supposed to be on developed engine trouble two days before our cruise,"
sd,"so they said we could either cancel, reschedule, or take whatever was available"
sd,"so we took whatever was available,"
sd,"and we left a day early, "
sd,"and they put us up at the cocoa beach hilton,"
sd,"and the ship that was available, the only, uh, rooms that hadn't been booked were the suites"
ba,wow
sd,so we got the suites at the same price as a regular cabin
ba,oh 
b,yeah
sd,"so then our cruise was actually extended a day,"
sd,"and our disney was extended a day,"
sd,so we turned a seven day trip into ten 
ba,"great,"
sd, and they paid for everything
ba,"well, that's great"
aa,yes
b,oh
sv,so that was a wonderful vacation
aa,"yeah,"
sv,i bet
sd,that sounds like the way i'd want to do it 
b,yes
qo,"well, what kind of things do you like to do when you go to colorado?"
sd,"oh, well, we like to ski, of course,"
sd,so we spend so much time with our families 
b,yes
sd,because we moved to texas about two years ago so when we go back we are just jam packed full of people to see and things to do 
b,yeah
sd," so we don't, we don't get a lot of time to just vacation"
sd,"we did, um, last year, though, go to san antonio for memorial day "
b,oh
b,uh-huh
sv,"uh, but, you know, other, other than that, with, with both my kids being under two, it's real hard "
b,right
%,"that would be, -"
b,yes
b,"i know,"
sd,"i think one of the places i always hit in colorado, is that current outlet store"
b,yeah
br,"that's what, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","you should mention that,"
sd,i just got my catalog this morning and was looking through it
qy^d,"oh, with the santa claus on the cover"
ny,uh-huh
b,"yes,"
sd,"i've already ordered from that one,"
sd,"but we will probably be going up at thanksgiving this year,"

sd,"oh, you're in texas"
aa,"yes,"
sd,i'm in the dallas area
sd,so am i
sd,i'm in garland
sd,uh 
b,yeah
sd,i talked to somebody from wisconsin or something the other day
b,oh
b,"yeah,"
sd,so i guess they get people from all over
aa,yes
b,"yeah,"
sv,"driving for thanksgiving, that's going to be quite a drive for, -"
aa,well it was when we left last year
sd,"we left on the eighteenth, right before that big snow storm hit colorado "
b,uh-huh
sd, and we pulled in just as it hit
ba,wow
qw,"so, how do you go?"
qy,"do you go up through the raton pass, when you go up there?"
nn,"uh, no,"
%,"ret-, oh, -"
^h,"well, wait a minute,"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"we do,"
sd,we do
sd,that's on like route two eighty-seven or something like that
b,"yeah,"
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,and then we go straight up through trinidad 
bk,okay
bk,"okay,"
sd,"we, uh, went a different way when we went last christmas because of bad weather and because we were pulling a little u haul trailer,"
sd,"because we had to take our dog in the car, there was no room for luggage"
sd,"so, we went all interstate"
sd,"we went up, um, through oklahoma city "
b,uh-huh
b,oh
sd, and it wound up only taking us about an extra hour
sd,it was a little more mile wise 
b,uh-huh
sd," but because you could go sixty-five miles an hour on the, -"
sd,"so, child care, your views"
sd,"uh, well, we only have one child right now and another one on the way"
sd,"and right now i'm, i'm all with her during the day"
%,"i, -"
sd,"if i was looking for outside care i probably would stay away from professional child care centers and try to find, if i was close to home, relatives or people with it is same values and possibly religious faith or something similar so that she would be raised in an environment that would be similar to what we would have in our own homes as, as parents"
qw,and what religious faith?
sd,"uh, latter day saints"
ba,oh 
sd,so 
sd,"with a teaching background i've, um, had a little bit of experience with the child day care type situations"
sd,but i've seen some good ones
sd,and i've seen some really bad ones
qy,"uh, they do seem to be at the outside edge of both extremes don't they?"
ny,"uh-huh,"
sv," and, "
%," and so, -"
aa,right
sv,"by trying to get them to conform to concern standards they, uh, kind of, uh, eliminate a lot of the, uh, -"
^2,better situations
aa,yeah
%,"the, the, uh, -"
t1,"what am i trying to think of that, < > not the imagination but the creativity in, in the situation -"
%,"and so, -"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,yeah
sv,"that's, that's very well phrased"
qy,"uh, so, have you ever used outside child care?"
nn,"no,"
ng,i haven't
sd,we've had like people come in and baby-sit for an hour or two
sd,"but i've never had, um, -"
^2,real day care
aa,right
sd,"she's, she's not even a year yet,"
sd,"so,"
%, uh 
sd, our step daughter's ten now 
b,uh-huh
sd, and most of the day care has been provide for by grandma
sd,"but, quite honestly what i believe to be the best day care situation was while we lived up, the pass of woodland park "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sd,"and they would read and play,"
bf," have a relative struct-, a structured, "
%," seem to be, "
aa,"uh, yeah,"
sd,"and, uh, despite our beliefs, she was, uh, one of the more, uh, < > charismatic christian faiths "
b,uh-huh
sd, and it worked out wonderfully
b,yeah
sv,"i know that, uh, that i guess if you have the opportunity to pick and choose and you've got the time and that, uh, i don't know if the resources are the proper term, you know, just the, the know, knowledge of who's a available, then you could probably find some really good care"
aa,"uh, yeah,"
sd,but i don't know that it would be state approved
aa,that's true
sd,you can get somebody maybe willing to baby-sit
sd,"but actual, you know, that's sometimes different, done on a different scale"
sd,"i have even considered, you know, baby-sitting myself, i have a teaching degree, and, uh, thought well, you know, i could structure and then for one reason or other decided not to,"
sd,"but i think if you take more than three children in, well, -"
sd,"that was how it was this virginia, we've recently moved here to texas, but in virginia i think if you take more than three children in on more than a several hours a day bases you have to be licensed"
%,"i, -"
sd,now i don't know what the current texas laws are
sd,"but i, but i do know that the license doesn't seem to, uh, < > guarantee quality"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"a lot of times you might just need to go now and feel, file for it just like a business"
sd,"you may not have to prove any type of qualification for it i don't, -"
sd,"uh, now here i believe that child care meets, by in large, certain standards for, uh, balanced food, if they provide food, cleanliness, < > and levels of supervision "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,"that's, uh, kind of a minimum there that you're getting"
sv,"your covering basic care there and not all the extras that most people would like to see done with there children, you know, like the educational activities, the supervised play and so forth"
sd,"uh, my wife is, uh, agnostic"
sd,"and i'm, uh, a backsliding presbyterian "
sd, i like that term 
sd," and, uh, < > get, i really believe that this charismatic care, or the charismatic belief when emphasized on care, or semi charismatic i might say "
b,uh-huh
aa,"yeah,"
bf,"it was a good influence for your daughter, uh"
aa,"yes,"
aa,very 
ba,"well, that's good"
sv," and, and, uh, < > the care is what i guess you should emphasize in the term child care instead of the child"
aa,uh-huh
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"a little bit of love and, and attention is what most of them need"
sv,"you know, even if it's not a real educated program you can have good educational program"
%,"and, and,"
^2,and not have any care
aa,right
sv,"and, and that's not certainly what you want for your child or what you would give your child yourself"
%,"and so, -"
sd,and i'm not sure that really child care per se should instill any education per se
qy,do you know had a i'm saying?
sv,"well, even educated play, uh, supervised play, can teach without, -"
sd,"and i'm not saying talking about sitting down and teaching them math or, or, or something like that but just kind of promoting social skills"
%,"and, uh, uh, you know, like my, my child that, -"
sd,"she want be an only child for long,"
sd,"but, you know, she was an only child,"
sd,"or maybe your daughter,"
bf, proper interface 
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"yeah,"
%,"just, -"
sd,"it's just, just correctness of, of < > social skills, if you will"
aa,"right,"
bf,"those basic things that, uh, they would, that, you know, you would be a little bit of, uh, i don't know if manners is a good term or not but,"
%,"and,"
sd,"that's done through example, you know, not an actual sit down learn situation"
%,"so, -"
b,"uh, yeah,"
sv,"uh, it's a very broad issue"
aa,"uh-huh,"
sv,it is 
sv,"and, < > you know, it's a shame"
sd,"but most people doing, child care earn almost no money"
sd,"they operate at, you know, -"
sd,"the owner of the chi-, of a, you know, a large child care facility now, -"
b, uh-huh 
sd," we're not talking somebody that does six kids,"
b, uh-huh 
bf,somebody that doesn't really put a lot of overhead whatever into it
bf,you mean somebody that has an actual establishment
aa,right
b,yeah
sd,their employees earn almost nothing
aa,yeah
sd,"i know i, i did that for summer "
sd,"so i can, i can vouch for that "
sv,"and that's really, really a shame too because, < > -"
qy,do you and your husband both work
nn,"no,"
sd,"just he does i'm, i'm here during the day with her"
ba,"well, that's wonderful if, if you can make it that way"
sd,"well, we, we decided to, -"
sd,we live on a lesser budget so that we have -
sd,"that, that's more important to us, you know, as, as, uh, there may come a time when i will be working again, you know,"
sd,but right now that's what we've chosen
sd,"and we wanted to have several, -"
sd,we got her
sd,"and we've got another on the way,"
sv," well, "
%,"so , -"
b,right
sv," but more and more we're being forced into a situation, we as americans are being forced into a situation, where you've got to have, -"
sv,"well a lot of women are knowl-, as knowledge about football as i am"
qy,"can i guess your favorite team, if you had one, might be the steelers"
ny,"yes,"
ny,uh-huh
sd,"well, i can understand that"
sd,"i, you know, i kind of like the cowboys, too"
qy, do you? 
na, they've had some great games in the past
b,"uh-huh,"
sd,"i, i always enjoy watching the stal-, the, dallas and pittsburgh together"
b,"uh-huh,"
aa,me too
sv,"it wasn't nearly as much fun when bradshaw was playing for you guys, i'll tell you"
sd,"he lives in the dallas area now, as a matter of fact"
qy,does he really?
sd,"well, actually, it's probably closer to fort worth,"
sd,"but it's, it's in the same area"
sd,"he bought, uh, bought a big horse farm out in a little town called roanoke, texas"
b,uh-huh
sd,but he pops up on the dallas scene quite often
sd,"as a matter of fact, there was some talk about trying to get him involved with the team management in some sort of a coaching job"
ba,"oh, wo-, -"
qy^d,i wonder if he'd ever do that
no,"i don't know,"
sv,he'd be good at it
sv,"he's such a motivator, he,"
aa, yes 
b, uh-huh 
sv, that would be his specialty
sv,"i wished, i wished they could work something,"
sd,i really like him
sd,i really do
b,uh-huh
qo,well what about the houston oilers
qy,do you like them?
ny,"yeah,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
sd,i'd love to see dallas and houston play in a super bowl
sv,that would be really great
b,uh-huh
sv,"that may not ever happen,"
h,i don't know
sv," uh, houston has had some wonderful talent, you know, down through the years"
sv,and in the earlier years they really had some super teams
b,uh-huh
sv,"and warren moon,"
ba, that's right 
aa,"he certainly is,"
sv,he's very good
b,uh-huh
sv,he's very good
sv,"he's one of the few, uh, black quarterbacks that there are"
aa,that's right
sv,"randall cunningham was with philadelphia, i guess last year,"
sd,but he's no longer with the team
sv,"< > so, you're right,"
sv,"there are very few black quarterbacks, or at least that are starting anyway"
b,uh-huh
qo,how do you think the steelers are going to do this year
qy,you have any idea
no,"i don't know,"
sv,"i hope they, they do better"
%,"they, they -"
sv,during the past couple of years they've been doing a little bit better
b,uh-huh
sv,"but, uh, i think they still have a little, i think they're still such a, a young team i think they still have a little bit to go before they reach the potential,"
b, yeah 
b,"oh, yeah,"
sv,that was just such super team
sv,"or, if they even reach that potential again, you know, they may never reach that again"
b,yeah
ba,"well that's a tough, -"
sv,"it would be tough to do,"
sv,it really would
b,uh-huh
qy^d,"they have such a super team for years, that won what, four super bowls?"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,four in a row
sd,four in a row
sd,i don't know if that could ever be duplicated again or not
sd,"oh, i don't know"
b, yeah 
sd, shooting for one for the thumb now is what they were saying
ba,that's right 
%,"and, -"
sd,"but basically everyone that was on the team then is gone now,"
%,so -
ba,that's right
sv,i think mike webster was left
sd,"but then he, he just left"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,yeah
%,uh
sv,"he may have been the last of the old guard,"
h,i don't know
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"i think he is,"
sv,i think he was
b,"uh-huh,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,they had such a super team
b,uh-huh
qy,have you been following the big draft that occurred yesterday?
nn," no,"
sd,i didn't
bk,i see
b,huh-uh
sv,"there's quite a bit of activity now,"
sv,"of course they had so many, you know, nice, uh, choices because their record was so lousy the last few years"
sd,"they picked up,"
%, uh 
sv,of course you never know
sv,"the guys they pick, you know, m-, may never play a game"
sv,"you jus-, never know,"
sv,"it's, it's a gamble,"
sv,it really is
b,"yeah,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"they may get hurt, or, not be able to participate at that level, if you know, -"
qw,"well who would you say is your favorite player, or has ever been your favorite player?"
qy,ever been?
ny,uh-huh
sd,"probably an old guy that played, probably before you were born ,"
sd,his name was sam huff
sd,he used to play for the new york giants
b,oh
sd,"that was one of the toughest guys that i've ever seen in my life,"
b, really 
sv,he just went all out every single play
b,uh-huh
sv,"of course, there have been some other great ones too, dick butkis, and bradshaw, you know,"
sv,there's been so many
b,"yeah,"
%,"ye-, -"
sd,"but if i had to pick one, i would probably pick sam huff, as a matter of fact"
sv,"oh, you know, that's really funny, um,"
sd,"well, i, i come from a large family"
sd,"and, the-, there's quite a few boys"
sd,so that's kind of how i got in with the football
sd,either watch that or watch nothing
b,that's right
sd,"and, um, at one time i could name all the players on the steelers, you know"
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, but, even when bradshaw was playing, i, i don't know, i, i didn't particularly care for him,"
b, uh-huh 
sd, i thought he was kind of cocky or something
sv," he is,"
sv,"he is, "
b, uh-huh 
sv,"of course the-, a quarterback has a big ego"
b,"yeah,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"they really d-, they have to have,"
sv,they can't survive
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"they always think they can win, you know, which is the way it should be"
b,uh-huh
sd,"boy, he never gave up, i'll tell you"
b,yeah
sd,"him and franco harris,"
sd,i really didn't care for the either two of them
b," uh-huh,"
b,"uh-huh, "
sv," i mean they were good,"
sv,"but, i, you know, you couldn't deny that"
b, oh yeah 
sd," but i didn't, i thought, you know, well i just didn't really care for either one of them"
b,uh-huh
sd,"uh, today, my favorites out of those guys were probably, um, lambert,"
b,uh-huh
b, uh-huh 
b,"uh-huh,"
aa,"absolutely,"
aa,i can't disagree with that
sv,"they were super players,"
sv,they really were
b,uh-huh
%,"they really, -"
sd,"i, i, i like, not just with the pittsburgh, i like watching on saturday afternoons when they'll have like the plays or the, the best plays from,"
b, uh-huh 
b,"yeah,"
sd,"highlights, yeah"
b,"yeah,"
sd,i love watching that
sd,"then i like watching their bloopers too, you know "
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"that's kind of funny too, as a matter of fact "
sv,"some of them a, a bit embarrassing"
%,"yeah,"
sv,"well they make mistakes too, i guess"
b,"yeah,"
b,"uh-huh,"
%," absol-, -"
sv, it's funny that more people don't get hurt
aa,absolutely
b," uh-huh,"
%,"oh they, "
aa,"oh, yeah,"
sv,it's funny some of their necks don't get broken
aa,"absolutely,"
sd,i don't know how they do it
sv,"it's, it must just take a hundred percent concentration, i guess, because they know they're going to get hit,"
sv,"it's just a matter of how hard, you know, or where"
b,yeah
sv,"an they have to be in ideal physical shape, basically"
aa,"oh, absolutely"
sv,they look like sometimes they're just broken in two like a match stem
sv,"gosh, what a beating, -"
sv,"they really do take a beating,"
sv,they really do
b,yeah
qo,"well what did you think of, um a couple years ago for the bears, the refrigerator"
sv,"i think he was just probably a passing phenomena, i think "
h,"i don't know,"
%,"i, i'm knowing what, you know, -"
sv,"of course, mike ditka was in dallas for years and years as coach, is knowing his, or, you know, knowing of his temperament, i'm just surprised he ever, you know, kept the guy around,"
sv,i really am
sv,"he's such a, he's about a half hot head anyway, such a temper"
sv,"oh, you know, and to me he does, um, oh, he's just so big and fat,"
b, uh-huh 
sv, he doesn't even look like he's in shape
sv,"he's just so big, no one can move him"
ba,"that's right, yeah,"
aa,absolutely
sv,"there's just so much mass there, i guess they just can't, -"
h,"i don't know, you know,"
%,"i, -"
sv,"probably the guy is, you know, probably physically strong"
%,"i, you know, -"
sv,obviously not very fast
b,uh-huh
sv,"but i guess it's just, like you say, a mass that nobody can seem t-, to get out of the way"
sv,"as far as him scoring touch downs, you know, i think that was kind of weird"
h,"i don't know,"
sd,"dallas has a guy, uh, his name is nate newton,"
sv,now he has a real weight problem too
sv,"he fights it every single year,"
sd,"but, he manages to still keep playing,"
sv,"but,"
b, yeah 
ba,wow
%,"they wa-, -"
sd,the coaches watch him all year long
sd,"they, they weigh him several times a year just to make sure he's not, you know, completely out of control"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but i guess most every team has so-, has someone like that,"
%,"i don't, -"
b,"oh, yeah,"
sv,"there's, there are some really big guys playing in football"
sv,"absolutely they get bigger and bigger, it seems every year"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i guess you have to to, you know, to stay in the game i guess"
b,"yeah,"
aa,"you would, uh-huh"
b,yeah
%,"um, now who, -"
qy,"would you say that you have a fav-, -"
qy,"i mean other than dallas, would you say that you have, uh, a favorite quarterback"
sd,"i mean the quarterback's seem to get most of the, the attention, you know"
ny,"oh, yeah,"
sd,"sure,"
sv,"well, you'd have to, uh, or i would have to say, you know, someone like montana, i guess, who's done so well for so many years"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i re-, i, i enjoy watching him play"
b,"yeah,"
sv,his age is about to catch up with him though
sv,he's no spring chicken anymore
b," no,"
sv,but he's still performing 
sv," and like you say warren moon's an excellent,"
sv,warren moon's an excellent -
sv,but he's very exciting to watch
aa,"yes he is,"
b," uh-huh,"
b,sure 
sv," i, i, i enjoy watching him also"
b,"uh-huh,"
aa,absolutely
qo,"what about, uh, marino?"
%,"uh, i'm, -"
h,"obviously he's a very good quarterback,"
sd,"i'd, i never was, you know, too, a whole lot of, a big fan, you know"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"he may, uh-huh"
ny,yes
sd,"he was,"
sv,i believe that's right at one point in time
%,"ye-, -"
sv,but he's a very young fellow
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sv,"of course a quarterback can look so good if he's got a lot, if he's got a good supporting cast, you know"
ba," that's true,"
ba,that's true 
sv," if not, he gets beat to death like poor old troy aikman has the last couple of years anyway,"
%,"you kno-, -"
%,"we-, -"
sv,"dallas did better last year,"
sv,hopefully they'll do better this year
t3," <<talking to someone else in the room>> uh, probably around twelve, uh-huh"
b,"yeah,"
h,"uh, i didn't, i don't know,"
sv,"i, i just think, you know marino will get better"
sv,"and, uh, his team's not as good as what it was when he went to the super bowl,"
ba, that's right 
%, so -
b,"yeah,"
sv,"miami's had some down years, too"
b,yeah
sv,"but they all do, i guess,"
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
ba," that's true,"
%,"ye-, -"
sv,"and with age comes,"
b," yeah,"
%,with -
%,"yeah, "
%,"the, the -"
sv,"i'm sure arthritis sets in with them,"
aa,"oh yes, very much so "
^2,"hip injuries and things like that, yeah"
b,"right,"
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sv,"that, that forces a lot of the guys to get out of the game"
b,"uh-huh,"
sv,"and they're so young,"
ba, that's right 
sv," but, they're retired, you know,"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i read some time, well not too long ago that the average, uh, professional career only lasts seven years"
sv,"so that's when you think about it, that's really not a very long time, of course"
b,"oh yeah,"
sv,but then you think about how many have been in there longer than that
sd,"but if the average is seven years that means a lot of guys don't make it seven years, you know"
b," yeah,"
sd,a lot of them would have to get out like in just a couple
%,"that's ri-, -"
sv,"holy smokes, i didn't that doesn't seem like very long"
sv,"that's, that's a pretty short career on average"
b,uh-huh
sv,"of course they play their, you know, cards right and do some good investments, they'll, you know, they'll do all right"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but a lot of them don't, unfortunately"
b,yeah
qo,"um, what do you think of the, uh, l a raiders,"
qy,"used to the, the oakland? -"
ny,"yeah,"
sv,"they, they're always branded, you know, as a bunch of outlaws"
sv,"and,"
sv," but that just may be, you know, perceived, -"
sv,"you know perception, -"
h,i don't know
b, yeah 
sv," al davis is, he's a kind of strange character, strange, strange looking guy"
sv,"apparently he's kind of a wild guy,"
h,i don't really know for sure
sv,"they've had some excellent teams, though, obviously"
aa,"yes,"
sv,they have
sv,"i'm not sure they've yet decided where they want to play,"
sv,"they keeping talk about, you know, going, -"
sv,now then i think that -
b,uh-huh
qy, are you there?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,i'm here
bk,all right
qy,do you have any one that has been in a nursing home?
sd,"uh, well, only my, um, my grandmother, but for a very short time"
sd,"um, she, uh, she was just more or less in a, in a nursing home for, uh, recovery from a broken hip "
b,oh
b,yes
%,"but, um, that, -"
sd,"physical therapy was there and whatever,"
sd,"but i think, in visiting her there, um, it was very obvious to see that a lot of the people in the nursing home that she was in, uh, weren't there mentally"
sd,"uh, she was probably the only person in the, um, whole nursing home that, uh, still had all of her mental facilities about her"
sd,"so that was, uh, that was very disheartening"
qw,"well, what do you think can be done about that?"
qw,"i mean, what can we do,"
b,"oh, yeah,"
sv,"it's really hard, i guess"
sd,"i, i come from a family of, um, of, uh, take care of your elders, i guess"
sd,"uh, my, my dad's mother is an invalid,"
sd,"and she lives with my aunt and uncle,"
sd,"and they care for her, you know, all around the clock"
sd,"though she's not, uh, she doesn't have to receive constant medical attention, she, because of arthritis, she's just unable to get out of bed"
sd,"so, i guess, you know, there's that family commitment"
sd,"um, i know that my parents, my mother is trying to let my grandmother stay in her house as long as she can um,"
%,"well, i can remembe-, -"
sd,of course i'm 
b,yeah
b,"right,"
b,yeah
sd,"we did not have to call on, on someone else,"
sd,"and i feel, -"
ad,"no, you tell me how you feel about, -"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"well probably, i think, as long as the person's able to, um, to understand what's going on around them -"
sd,"and i think, you know, my grandmother right now is still able to walk around,"
sd,"and she's still able to, uh, to do some things for herself, though she gets meals on wheels "
b,yeah
aa,"certainly d-, -"
%,uh
sd,"i worked with an agency in west texas that they, it's where they really started this concept of meals on wheels "
b,uh-huh
sv, and i think it's such a valuable thing for our elderly
b,uh-huh
sv,"if they didn't have to, you know, go into a kitchen -"
b,right
sd," my mother expired just, just a little over a year ago,"
sd,"and we had finally, -"
sd,she didn't want to live with either my sister or me 
b,uh-huh
sd," but we, we got, found a retirement center for her,"
sd,and it was beautiful
sd,"and they had all these, they didn't even have nursing care there"
%,"so until, -"
sd,"as long as mother was, you know "
b,uh-huh
b,right
sd,and she was with people with whom she enjoyed
b,"yeah,"
%,"that, -"
sv,"i think, you know, it's really funny,"
sd,"i have two grandmothers still alive,"
sd,and my one grandmother says that she wants to stay in her house for as long as possible
sd,she's like openly told people
sd,"she's always been very good about knowing, -"
sd,"yes, she's eighty-nine,"
sd,"and she said that she would really like to stay in her house as long as possible, because it's her home"
b,sure
sd,"but when the time comes, um, she, and she can't do things"
sd,"and she has to be cared for, whatever, she would prefer, and she's actually said this, to move into some type of community where she has her own apartment, uh, probably with like a living space and a bedroom "
ba,"yes, sir"
sd,"but if she wants to go to a meal, she can go down the hallway, uh, to a room where there's a cafeteria "
b,uh-huh
sd," and there's other people there,"
sd,and she can mix with them and talk with them and enjoy their company
sd,being a widow 
b,uh-huh
b,yes
b,uh-huh
sd,"i have just recently retired,"
sd,and i am finding it extremely hard to adjust to
b,right
sd,"so, uh, mother had the little kitchenette "
b,uh-huh
sd," and she could do all these fine things that she just, ha-, had a microwave, had to pop "
b,right
sd,now this is wonderful
b,uh-huh
sd,"but when it came time for a full meal, then mother was able to go with people "
b,"right,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"i think, i think that probably, until, until they're really invalids, uh, the elderly are invalids, i think that they should be able to interact with other people "
aa,"oh, i think so"
%,well -
sd,"i mean, um, see, i know that my grandmother would like to stay in her house,"
sd,"and my parents actually said, you know, that they may have to take their end, sometime, so, because, you know, my grandma, she says who she wants to live with,"
sd,"she's pretty, you know, -"
sd,"she lets people know,"
qo,"what do you think about the, uh, peace corps or public service commitment?"
sd,"uh, that's the first i've ever heard of it"
sd,"i haven't heard of it, anything too much about it"
%,"um,"
sd,"well, i think it was, uh, thought up when there was so much controversy about reviving a draft"
sd,"and people said, well, they, uh, young people who were drafted have to provide military service to the country,"
sv,"but there are an awful lot of young people who would benefit from, um, some sort of public service,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and it seems to me that it's, it's not a totally bad idea,"
sd,but i don't quite see how they'd make it work
b,uh-huh
qh,"how would they decide who goes into, uh, building fire breaks in yosemite national park and who goes to saudi arabia?"
aa,"right,"
aa,yeah
%,"i, -"
%,"the, -"
sd,"my first impression was, um, it would be v-, very good"
sv,"i think it would be good for people to serve,"
sd,but i don't know if it should be an option
sv,it would be great to have some of those organizations like you mentioned that were during the depression or coming out of the depression available for kids
sd,"and i think there are some available now where they are able to work,"
sv,"but making it a mandatory thing kind of, -"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"the, the difficulty would be in whether it's voluntary or involuntary"
b,right
sd,"and the people who were proposing it said that it should be involuntary, that it should be like a draft"
b,uh-huh
sd,and some people would get military service
sd,"and some people would get civilian, uh,"
%,"this, -"
sv,"i assume it's the kinds of things that they had conscientious objectors do,"
sd,"they were allowed to do hospital service or, uh, things like that,"
%,"and if they re-, -"
sd,or farm work in world war one i remember 
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, and i suppose that there is, uh, justification for taking everybody if you take anybody"
b,uh-huh
sv,"but i just really think that the difficulties involved in paying them, uh, sorting them out, assigning them,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"it seems like you'd have a lot more conscie-, conscientious objectors if they had that choice"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,well it's a possibility
b,"yeah,"
sd,"you know, i'd, i'd much rather work in a hospital than, than to go war"
sv,and i'm sure most young men and women would
%,"and so, uh, -"
sd,"well, i think that in the, in the cases that, like that, uh, they had to be, uh, pretty thoroughly examined to prove that they had pacifist and religious beliefs and so forth,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"it was, uh, something that was a fundamental part of their philosophy of life"
b,uh-huh
ba,"well, that makes sense"
sv,"and then you run into, again, to, um, the bureaucracy in running it"
qh,"you know, how you going to "
b,"oh, yeah"
aa,"sure,"
sv,"and,"
%," so, -"
b,right
sv,"and then you have to pay them some kind of a stipend,"
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv,plus the training involved
b,"oh, yeah"
b^m,"yeah,"
sv,that would be expensive in most cases
b,"yeah,"
%," because , -"
sd,"now i had a lot of friends who went to the peace corps, uh, back in the mid sixties "
b,uh-huh
sd," and it really did seem to be a worthwhile organization,"
sd,"but on the other hand, i'm not sure what the permanent value of it was"
sd,"i don't,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"we had an awful lot of idealistic people who went off to, uh, what was then east pakistan is now bangladesh,"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but i don't know if they really had significant effects in the places where they went,"
b,uh-huh
%,"well, i know in, -"
sd,i personally took a year and a half and went as a missionary and taught christianity in japan
b,uh-huh
sd,and i was living such a stringent lifestyle that it was very beneficial to me
sd,"it taught me not to be so self-centered and it, you know, to think of others"
b,uh-huh
sd,"but i don't know if i was doing it in different situation, you know, not a really religious background, if, if i would get a lot out of it"
sv,"you know, i think i did because it, you know, it emphasized that sort of thing"
sd,"you know, a lot of "
b,sure
sd,"and it was definitely voluntary, too"
sd,"they were not drafting you and sending you,"
b,right
b,right
sv,"and that, i'm sure that would make a big difference, too"
%,"you know, you've got , -"
aa,yeah
qo,"well, what about a voluntary program?"
qy,do you think that would be a good idea?
sd,"um, well, like i say, i know that there are some type of programs that they have available for a youth, like teenagers to go and do, um, work in the national parks and work in, uh, neighborhoods to do, um, clean up and that sort of thing"
sd,but i don't know what organization it's under
sd,i don't know if it's a government run or if it's a private 
sd,i don't either
sv,"but i know that that helps a lot with training and, um "
aa,"yeah,"
sd,"out here in california,"
sd,"and they don't have to be locked up go to these, uh, camps"
sd,"and they,"
b,uh-huh
sd,they maintain trails
sd,"and they, uh, put up signs"
sd,and they do fire prevention work and certainly things of that sort
b,uh-huh
sd,"and that i know is run by the state,"
sd,but there may be other things
sd,"i'm not so sure what kind of, uh, training that is for the future for those kids"
b,"yeah,"
qh,"how much benefit,"
sv,"it's probably a,"
sv,"but whether it's something that they can put to, to economic use later on is a different subject"
aa,"right,"
sv,"especially in, you know, if you take a, a child that's from the inner city and then put them in the, a middle of a park,"
sv,"if they go back to the inner city, they may not see trees for a while,"
aa,that's true 
ba,"good point , oh"
sv,"so that's, yeah, so that may not, may not benefit them in the long run"
b,yeah
%,"but, -"
b,"yeah,"
fa,"i'm sorry,"
fc,"i'm going to have to go,"
fc,but my other line is blinking
fc,"okay,"
fc,"well, thank you"
fc,but it was good to talk to you
fc,"you, too,"
fc,bye-bye
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","okay,"
ad,you want to tell me first how you feel about 
sv,well 
b,uh-huh
sv,"i know, like the mormon religion, you know, they require two years of service, uh, missionary service "
sd,the boys 
aa," right,"
sd,the boys 
sd," not the girls, the boys"
b," yeah,"
sv,"and, um, so, but i think it would be good for all young people "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
aa,uh-huh
sv,"i, i thought it would be good, too,"
sv,but i did not think it would be good that they all do something like the peace corps 
b,yeah
b,uh-huh
sv,but there's a lot of other public service things 
b,"oh, sure"
b,"oh, yeah,"
sv,"and, and even, even in our home towns there's a lot of "
b,uh-huh
b,right
b,right
b,"yes,"
b,yeah
sv," and i think that art of giving is something that, um, we don't have very much any more"
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
sv,i think it would be that
qy,"when they say this proposal, is this something that they're just suggesting,"
qy,"or are they actually, -"
qw,"why, why, why did they call it a proposal,"
%,"that, -"
sd,"oh, i think they just gave it a title "
b,uh-huh
sd," but is this not something that's, um, in legislation or "
b,uh-huh
sd,that's what i wondered
b," yeah,"
nn,"no, no,"
sd,"it's not,"
sd,"it's just a, just a topic,"
sv,it'd be good character builder
aa,"i think so, too"
aa,"i think so, too"
sv,"um, because there's so many, um, kids who have, uh, you know, so much money and so much free time and, uh, nothing to do, um, and nothing to give their time to"
b,uh-huh
sv,"um, they don't even have a direction to give their, their time to,"
sv,so i think 
b,right
b,uh-huh
%," so, um, yeah,"
sv,"it would be, it'd be really good "
b,uh-huh
sd,"well, people that are, um, have received sentences in jail, they have, uh, some of them are going out and doing, uh, they have to go out and do public service "
b,uh-huh
b,right
aa,"oh, yeah,"
aa,"oh yeah,"
sv,i agree with you
sv,"this is something that, um, like you say, is it's character building "
b,uh-huh
%,"and, -"
sv,"well, i think sometimes it gives you a better picture of what some of the other people live like, you know, what "
b,uh-huh
b,right
b,"uh-huh,"
b,"uh-huh,"
b,yeah
%,"or, -"
aa,"oh, i agree with you,"
aa,"i agree with you,"
sv,"and i think, uh, young people are so, um, uh, focused just on themselves and their activities, and whose going out with whom, et cetera "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
b,yeah
b,"yeah,"
sv,"because that's one thing that's hard, with young people, you, you can't tell them how things are "
b,right
sv, they have to see for themselves 
b,uh-huh
sv," now of course this might be after they've gone through their teen years,"
sv,i don't know what their thought is on what age that this should be done
b,"oh, yeah,"
sv,"i would think so, like right after, um, high school "
b,uh-huh
b,uh-huh
sv, of course they've already gone through the period of time where they need more direction 
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv,"course now peace corps, that couldn't be done of course, until they were done with school "
b,"right,"
b,"right,"
sv,"you know, something that out, that was outside of, uh, outside of school "
b,uh-huh
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc"," yeah,"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc","but, yeah,"
sv,"you know, right, right after you graduate from, um, high school, because a lot of people are just, um, uh, well gee whiz, what do i do now "
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, uh, you know, having that, that, uh, gung ho plan "
b,uh-huh
sv,kind of an in-between 
b,uh-huh
b,"uh-huh,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,"so to me, see that would be the, the, uh, the greatest time for, um, you know, teenagers to, to do that, would be right after they graduated from high school"
b,uh-huh
sv,but as for its being required 
b,yeah
b,huh-uh
aa,"no,"
sv,"and like i said, not, now all young people should be able to do something,"
sv,but 
b,uh-huh
sv,i mean 
b,right
sv,but 
b,"oh, right"
sv,they're just not made to do that type of thing 
b,"uh-huh,"
b,uh-huh
sv, and they just aren't able to do it
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
b,"so, um, yeah,"
sv,it'd be good
sv,"but like i said, requiring it would be, uh, -"
sv,"uh, with regard to, uh, to jury trials i, you know, i, i really feel as though, uh, jury trials are, are, uh, whatever system has been, been used historically, in particular jurisdiction, you know, is really the, the only kinds of things that you can use because the, the jurisprudence is, you know, based on, on, uh, you know, on accumulated n-, body of law"
sv,"and if, if you have a situation where you change that body of law, then all of sudden they, they start, they could start going back and digging up all these cases that, uh, that would be handled differently were "
sv,"so i, i really don't think it, they can really do much of anything to change it"
qo,what do you think? 
sv," uh, i, i don't think so"
sv,"possibly in the jury selection would be the only, -"
sd,"just for example, what we're seeing in california i guess"
sv,"it makes you wonder, uh, had the jury been a different group of people what would have happened with that outcome"
%," well won't, -"
sv,well maybe they used a little bit too much force with stuff like that
sd,but then 
b,uh-huh
sd,"and, you know, the "
sv," that's, that's bad "
b,uh-huh
sd, and they didn't get beat up
aa,no
%," it , -"
sv,"rodney got beat up because he, he, you know, he pur-, you know, he involved himself in some sub, self-destructive behavior"
b,uh-huh
sv,"and, uh, uh, just like the burning and looting "
b,uh-huh
sv, everybody 
aa," oh, yes "
^q,and they're going to rebuild
^q,and it'll be even better
qh,"hey, what do you think,"
qh,"you know, some, some black guy with capital is going to come in and invest in that area?"
aa,that's right
sv,"with everybody with that mind set they, they're "
sv, they're only going to suffer
sv,"and you might even be able to, to use it for, for a bombing test site, you know"
sv,"t-, they're only going to suffer"
sv,"they, they've defeated themselves with, with their looting and violence"
sd,"uh, i understand why they were upset by the verdict just because even those of us that aren't black or, uh, don't live there or whatever, we all saw the same thing on the, on the tape"
%,"and, uh, -"
sv,"well e-, everybody is saying this is going to be a new era"
sv,and we're going to reexamine this thing
sv,"hey, the b-, the average person is going to take a look at that and say, suspicions confirmed"
^q,"they're a bunch of animals, you know"
qh,how can you really deal with an environment where you're going to lose everything
sd,forty deaths
sd,i mean there are forty people 
aa, i know 
aa,"yeah,"
sv,it's really ridiculous
sd,"and i'm just trying to determine, you know, how you address, how you weigh, you know, rodney getting, getting the hell beat out of him against, you know, forty deaths"
bf,"against forty other people being, -"
aa,yeah
sd,"and there's no other, -"
sd,"i'm not su-, exactly sure, uh, what the circumstances surrounding the deaths -"
sd,and i'm very upset that the news media has not identified those deaths 
b^m,those deaths
b, uh-huh 
qy,is it a looter that got shot by a store owner?
%," i, you know, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",no tears 
qy," or just a by-, an innocent bystander or somebody got actually beat to death or what"
b,yeah
sd, and 
%, um 
sd,"you know, you, you see film of people being pulled out of a car and shot, you know, in, in the street"
^2," or, or beaten"
sd,"and, and my reaction is i would have run over fifty people before, rather than stop"
sd,"and, uh, and there, there would have been just nothing but carnage after, after, after "
%,"um <<very, very faint>>"
sd, no one 
b, right 
aa,"that's, that's exactly how i feel too"
sd,"i wouldn't have, uh, they wouldn't have stopped my car for any, anything had i seen them coming"
sv,"but i was just wondering since you're, you're in, you're back east, uh, and a little closer to the, the bigger cities than we are in idaho here"
aa,right
sd,i'm inside the beltway
b,oh
sd,"you know how capital gang, they always say well inside the beltway, they think thus"
sd,"and so and i say well wait a minute,"
^q,i'm inside the beltway
^q,and i don't think like that
b,uh-huh
sd,i'm a government employee
b,oh
qw,"in what, uh, section of the government do you work? "
sd, i'm with the f b i
b,oh 
ba,"oh, that's interesting "
aa,yes
sd,"an-, and so, uh, uh, and, and the reason i'm doing this whole thing is because rick,"
b,uh-huh
sd,and he wanted another collection a year later
b,oh
sd,and so this is my seventh call
sd,a year ago i did eleven calls
bk,"oh, i see "
sd,"and so that's, that's why, uh, uh, that's why i'm religiously getting on the phone because i have a unique, you know, i have a unique situation here in that if i don't participate, -"
"fo_o_fw_""_by_bc",all right
b," <<people in background>> yes,"
sv,i think we're terribly taxed
sv,"i, i think the republicans have taxed us just as much as the democrats,"
sv,and i don't think there's a change between one party than the other
sv,"uh, i think we get a lot back,"
sv,but not as much as we should
sv,"uh, i guess what i feel about it is that it's so mismanaged that it, there's got to be something"
sv,"when, when we pay so much for the, for the debt, instead of using the money for where "
b, right 
%,"what kills me is when they had a chance to, to, uh, put into ac-, action the, the g-, the glen-, rub-, -"
qw,"what is it, uh, the act where they had to cut everything across the board "
sd,"the gramm, the gramm rudman act"
%,yeah 
sv," they kept doing, they kept putting off doing that"
qh,why did they do that?
sv,that's exactly what they needed to do to get their act together
b,"yeah,"
sv,well i think they spend too much
sv,"they, they spend too much on themselves, too,"
sv,"the, the,"
aa,"oh, yeah,"
aa,i think so too
aa," yeah,"
sv,well things like mailings
sv,they don't use any kind of restraint on some of these things
sv,they just think once they get there that they can do just anything
ar,"no,"
sd,"they don't, they don't try to, uh "
aa,"no,"
aa,you're right
sv,"and of course, here at home, we end up conserving and conserving"
sd,"and, i mean, when i don't have money, i don't buy something"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,no
sv,"i think, uh, it is the congress and them just don't have any interest in saving us money, uh,"
aa,they sure don't seem to
sv,the national debt is terrible
%,"uh, -"
sv,"there are a couple of things i think we need to really work for,"
sd,and i don't know quite how to do it
sv,"but i think we need to have the one line, uh, uh, veto so that they don't have to spend so much time doing everything"
sv,if it's a good idea 
b, right 
b," oh, yeah "
sv," you know, and if it's not, so what"
sv,at least you haven't thrown out all the work they've done for months and months and months and months
sd,"i saw one on twenty twenty about a month ago i guess, whereas one, i think that he was a senator from pennsylvania or something like that"
sd,"maybe it was, uh, connecticut,"
sd,"i'm not sure,"
sd,"one of the small states up there, where he had a bill through for another, uh, a drug agency that would be located there,"
sd,and he was the only one that wanted it
sd,was going to cost millions of dollars
sd,"the drug agency didn't want it,"
sd,and he was going to build it in his home town
sd,"and they were going to hire a lot of people,"
sv,"and it was ridiculous, you know, the whole thing "
aa," yeah,"
aa,"this is, that's right "
sd," and, and, you know, they asked him about it"
^q,do you really need this?
^q,this is going to cost a lot of money
^q,oh yes
^q,we need it
^q,but do you know that the drug agency doesn't want this?
b,yeah
sv,"and they do things that are, you know, just like the, uh, -"
aa," yeah,"
sv,that's just an awful lot of that kind of thing going on
aa,yeah
aa, that 
sv," and the trouble is, you don't, you have so little input about it"
sv,you don't know 
b, right 
b,right
%," i, -"
sv," they're supposed to do what we say,"
sv,"but they do what they, they want to do with it "
aa," yeah,"
aa,that's right
sv," the other thing about is i think, uh, limiting their time in office would be good"
sd,"i, i just "
aa," absolutely,"
aa,absolutely 
sv,we need to get that through
sv,"we, we have said that, i've said it several times on different subjects about the government that two yea-, two terms is enough for all of them"
b,yeah
sv,"uh, whether you're mayor, all the way up, city council, the works, i think certainly president, that, uh, two terms is plenty"
aa,yeah
aa,i think that's right 
sv," and then we get these professionals out of there,"
sv,"and they have to learn how to earn a living again themselves, you know, rather than "
aa," yeah,"
sv,wouldn't that be too bad 
aa,"well, that's right"
%,"i think, -"
h,"i don't know,"
sv,"i think, uh, people in general, -"
sv,"the, the, the idea of what you need to, to exist is so outrageous that it's not "
b, uh-huh 
sv," you know, it starts at the courts,"
sv,it starts everywhere 
b,right
sv,"well, it's so much money"
sv,"and you can't even add it up, you know,"
aa," no,"
sv,"you can't even, "
sv," that's why they think, -"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,when you talk about the trillions of dollars 
b,yeah
sd,our national 
b, yeah 
%,"i mean it jus-, and, and you just, -"
sv,"the other thing is, it's, it's all very well to give money to help people, other people,"
sv,and i think we need to do that
sv,"but there are, they need to put more limits on them"
sv,they need to restrain 
^2," foreign aid,"
%,yeah
sv,foreign aid means to go down to almost zero unless it's absolutely 
b,yeah <<very faintly>>
sv," they, they've given that away for fifty years "
sv," i, i, you know, i think that's probably, un-, unless we can afford it, -"
sv,if we pay off the debts then we can give it to people again
aa,"i agree,"
aa,i agree
sd,"you know, i don't really mind helping people,"
sv,"but you, you need to get rid of this thing that's, that's just, uh, eating us up "
b,uh-huh
sv,"if it were, if it were a family, we'd be up before the, the magistrate "
b,right
sv,"but the government does it,"
sv,and it's all right
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"i, i know we're taxed to death on every, every thing"
sd,"i don't know what's the best way to do it,"
sv,"but, uh, they don't even talk about that"
sv,they just raise it
sv,"they don't even consider it, like you saying "
aa," yeah,"
aa,that's true 
%," well, sounds like -"
sv,"they are at least doing something now, with the, the military, you know,"
sd,"they're cutting some of that,"
sv,"but of course, now, you know t i,"
sv,"you know that's hurting us but although, -"
aa," yeah,"
sv,it's good to see them doing some things there anyway
sv,but t i has gotten a lot of good contracts from the war and everything else
sv,"and if they'll get a lot of programs in the future because of their exotic, uh "
b,yeah
sd,"but, uh, that's the only good that i've seen congress do, you know, and everybody "
%,well -
sv," i think we have to accept the fact that whatever happens, we're going to have to bite the bullet"
sv,and we're all going to have to do it
sv,"i, it just isn't fair, though, that when this happens in some places, it needs to all come off everywhere"
aa,"yeah,"
aa,yeah
sd,"that's why i thought, well, you know, this is the time"
sv,"they need to put that into act-, into action and show they mean business that they've got to cut, they've got to cut costs"
aa,yeah
sv,"the only taxes i think that are well spent, -"
%,"well not the only, but, uh, -"
sd,"i think the, now i, i don't understand the present school thing,"
sd,"but, uh, i have two daughters,"
sd,"one's in college already,"
sd,and one's about to be in high school
sv,"but uh, i think that paying for school, schools is the, schools is the only answer really to get rid of crime"
sd,and so i don't mind paying for school 
aa," yeah,"
aa,i think that's right 
sd," well, i don't, i don't really mind paying taxes for, for positive things that are helps, like roads and "
b,yeah
sv,"but, um, you know, it, you just feel like it's out of control"
sv,you feel like 
b, yeah 
sv, the spending is out of control 
sv,"and that, and so then it just aggravates you, you know,"
sv,"you think, i could spend my money,"
^q,i could help the poor people better by myself than they're doing
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"oh, i agree with you"
%,"so it's, -"
sv,"i, i think that's a wide open subject "
b,yeah
sv,people need to take a stand
sv,"i think the people will here shortly, uh"
aa,"well, i think that's right"
sv,"if they don't do, if they don't, if they don't pull it in and start doing something, i think they're really going to have to i think"
sv,"i think the next time we have an election we need to try to get some of the ones that have been there forever out, too, that, what they did last election,"
sv,"and, uh, ninety some odd percent of the same old boys got back in, you know,"
sv,"so we need to try to get people to two terms so they respect our wishes, you know"
sv,they're supposed to represent us
sv,that's what they're called 
b,yeah
sv, but they don't
b,yeah 
sv,"may, may, may, maybe we can change and get us rid of some of those guys that are in there, guys and gals whatever they are"
b,"yeah,"
sv,in some ways we're awful lucky i guess
sd,"there a lot of, lot of places where it's worse than it is here"
sv,but 
aa,"i know,"
%,but it -
aa," no,"
aa,"that's right,"
aa," you don't want to,"
aa," no, "
sv, you want it to stay as good as it possibly can be 
sv," we need to get, try to get hold of it and, and have it be, things be honest"
sd,"and, i guess, in the fact i don't really mind paying taxes"
sd,but i would just like to know that they're not being foolishly spent that they're doing something that's positive for 
b,right
sd,"i don't really feel like, uh, i don't really feel like i use taxes very much "
h,i don't know
sd,maybe 
aa," yeah,"
aa,"that's, you're right "
sd, i guess i do
sd,"i use them in the, in roads and lot of things,"
%,"but, uh -"
sv,"well i think one of the good ones in the metroplex, uh, in the last say twenty-five years or so, maybe longer, they've built all these dams"
sd,"you know, the corps of engineers have, uh, soon as they finish a lake, they'll go at, get another one"
sd,"and that we haven't had, we've had droughts here in long summers "
b,yeah
sv," we've had good water supply,"
sd,"and that's due to the corps of engineers building, looking years ahead and building all these reservoirs for us, you know "
aa," yeah,"
aa,they've done some good things
sv,"the state actually did some good, good work on that, in that a couple of years ago"
b,yeah
sd,"uh, sam johnson came out and talked to us about that "
b, yeah 
sv,"and they, they really had done some good, some good work"
aa,"yeah,"
sv,i think anything for water supply like that 
b, yeah 
sv,california should do more of that too
aa,"yeah,"
sv,"there are a lot of p-, places where they're in real trouble,"
sv,and

%,"are we, -"
sv,"well, i think we need to do more"
sd,"i mean, i know i need to do more"
sd,"they have programs around where you can reach the, uh, -"
sd,they come and pick up your newspapers if you have them bundled up
b,uh-huh
sd,"but i have a hard time of being able, of separating, you know, having a place, separating my trash,"
sd,and get all the 
b,yeah
sd,"and, you know, i just haven't gotten that dedicated yet "
%,so -
sd,"i do a lot of work with the boy scouts,"
sd,and we try to do a lot 
b,uh-huh
sd, but there's still a lot more we can do
b,yeah
sd,"you know, i don't recycle my newspapers myself,"
sd,"but i noticed in one of the sales catalogs this weekend they have a, like a, a clothes hamper kind of thing that, you know, you lay your string in, then you put your papers in there "
b,uh-huh
sd,so i figured i might get me one of those 
b,uh-huh
sd,"sometimes it just sits around for a while,"
sd,and then we just chuck it
b,"yeah,"
sd,"well, i don't, i don't get the paper every day,"
sd,"but, you know, i get it on, -"
sd,"i try to buy, you know, the early edition for the coupons, you know, the sunday edition"
%,so -
b,yeah
sd,"but, then i just, you know, bundle it up and put it on the front, you know, the front walk ev-, "
b,yeah
sd,but that's the extent of what i've done
sd,i'd like to be able to do more
sd,"the problem is, with a lot of it is, you have to go, you know, it takes a while to drive to these places where you recycle it, you know "
b,yeah
%,"see, and, -"
sd, it's not always convenient to do it
b,"yeah,"
sd,"see, and here in lubbock everything's so close"
sd,i can imagine what it's like up there
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i'm not exactly sure where the, you know, the can thing is,"
sd,"but, you know, sometimes it's just so, -"
sd,"seems so much easier just to take it and throw it in the trash, and have "
b,yeah
sd,"see, i went out to payless cashways here a couple of days ago, as a matter of fact, and got me one of those little can crushers that i could put on the wall "
b,uh-huh
sd," and then i put me a little five gallon bucket,"
sd,and it's just outside the garage door 
b,uh-huh
sd, so every time we drink a coke or whatever we crush the can and just drop it into the bucket
qy,do those can crushers work good?
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i got one from payless cashways,"
sd,and it's actually metal 
b,uh-huh
sd, it's not plastic
sd,i didn't want to buy a plastic one
aa,yeah
sv,because those things i think would just snap 
b,yeah
sd,but payless cashways has them
sd,"and they're metal,"
sd,"and i don't know what affiliate of payless cashways you have up there,"
sd,"but it was only like seven dollars, not too bad"
b,oh
sd,"i'd have to check into something like that, because, i mean, we don't drink a whole lot of soda around here, you know,"
sd,"but, um "
b,yeah
qy,"but, you know, for other kind of cans, just to, it'd probably only take aluminum cans like that, don't they"
ny,"yeah,"
%,"i don't, -"
ny,"yeah,"
sd,"i don't think it would crush steel cans,"
sd,it's pretty tough
b,"yeah,"
h,"so i don't know,"
sd,"i don't think you have to crush the other ones for them to get to take that,"
sd,"but,"
b,"no,"
sv,"you could probably just, you know, -"
%,"you know, it's, you know, it, -"
sd,"sometimes, even with the newspaper they say they'll only take certain types of paper, you know,"
sd,they won't take 
b,yeah 
sd," they won't, yeah, they won't take any lint free paper"
sd,"or, see, i work at t i"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"so does my husband,"
%,yeah
sd,we do a lot of recycling out there
b,uh-huh
sd,"now we recycle all our computer paper and our cardboard,"
sd,but that's just now come on board
b,uh-huh
sd,"you know, we've been throwing paper out there away for years,"
sd,and we're just now getting on board to recycling 
b,uh-huh
b,"yeah,"
%,"i don't know what, -"
%,"you know, i haven't, -"
sv,i'm sure they're probably doing that here some
aa,"yeah,"
sv,i'm sure they are
sd,"t i is doing it pretty well nation-wide, i'm sure"
b,uh-huh
sv,"i think it's necessary,"
sd,"i, i like it,"
%,"you know, it makes, -"
sd,"i think it's good that you see these, you know, like boxes, cereal,"
sd,"they're now starting to make them, you know, the packages out of recycled paper,"
sd,"and,"
b,"oh, yeah"
sd,and i think they're just fine
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i bought a, -"
sd,"i got one at work that i bought for one of the guys there at work,"
sd,"it's his birthday,"
sd,"we're pretty good friends,"
sd,and what it is is a recycled paper bag 
b,uh-huh
sd," and it's just got happy birthday printing on it, and a cute little phrase inside,"
sd,and it's just a paper bag 
b,uh-huh
sd," you know, and it's really cute"
b,yeah
sv,"but, i think we're doing better and better all the time,"
b,yeah 
%," still don't, -"
sv," i think we're getting, becoming more conscious because we just can't stick everything in landfills any more"
%,so -
aa,"no,"
sv,"there's not going to be any room, shortly"
aa,"no,"
aa,"no,"
%,"the office, -"
sd,i don't know what new york does about theirs
sv,i guess they still ship it out on barges somewhere
aa,"yeah,"
sv,it's probably sitting out on the barge somewhere 
b,"yeah,"
sv,so but i think we're getting better at it 
b,yeah
sv, i think there's quite a bit more we could do
t3,"<<talking to someone in the room>> girls, put that away"
t3,now
sd,"but, you're right sometimes it does seem like it's more trouble than what it would be worth"
b,"yeah,"
sd,"i just wish it was a little more conv-, convenient "
b,yeah
sd,"you know, seems like you're so busy anyway,"
sd,and then that's just one more thing to have to worry about
%,so -
aa,"yeah,"
ba,it sure is
sv,"i think if, you know, the cities, locally, you know, they'd get more programs going so that you could do that, it'd make it a lot easier"
%,so -
b,"yeah,"
b,yeah
sv,"well, they'll get at it sooner"
sv,"i guess the schools will get into it, too, sooner or later"
b,"yeah,"
b,"yeah,"
sv,get the kids 
%,"you know they have, -"
sd,"we tried to have an aluminum can drive with the cub scouts that i have,"
sd,and we just don't have any place to store those kind of cans
b,yeah
sd,"you know, if we go out and pick up a bunch of cans from people, sure they'll save them for us, there's no problem there"
b,uh-huh
qh,but what do you do with them in the meantime?
ba,that's right
sd,"now i don't want a can, a garage full of cans "
ba,"that's right,"
qh,who does
sv,you know 
%,you know -
aa,"no,"
sv,"they're just not, they're not prepared for it"
aa,"no,"
sd,"and in texas, they're just get, things like that, -"
sd,they just get bugs in them
%,so -
aa,"yeah,"
aa,"yeah,"
sd,they do
%,"so, you don't, -"
sd,"you know, the more trash you have laying around the more bugs you get,"
sd,that's for sure

sd,about the only thing i really recycle around here is aluminum cans
b,uh-huh
%,so -
sd,"well, i need to get, get better at it"
%,so -
sv,"well, if we all try a little bit, a little bit goes a long way"
aa,"yeah,"
ba,"that's right,"
ba,that's right
